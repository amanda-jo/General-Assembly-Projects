None of the passengers I’ve driven have had any negative vibes with me, if anything I get relaxed and nice passengers. The only ones I’ll complain about are the ones that smell really terrible or will eat in my car without my permission (I state this in my description clearly so I hope for riders to see this!).\\n\\nI’ll get a 3 star rating occasionally for having a “dirty car” but it’s the winter time and people scuff the back of the front seats leaving streaks of mud and salt on them as well as on my doors. I’m just addressing my concerns because I’m getting two-faced riders and this is unfair. I drive well and intend to safely transport my passengers safely, my Lexus is a very smooth ride and I’m relaxed all the time when I drive but I can’t help but feel people will always be so anal about the little things (I.e dirty floor mats or just a random rating because I don’t talk a lot and I don’t because most of my passengers barely say hi let alone break the ice). \\n\\nSo what gives and how can I improve my rating?

Almost immediately, the app noted that my arrival was going to be later than expected, probably because of the extra passenger\\'s pick-up/drop-off spots being out of the way.\\n\\nAnyway, I was only taking a ride to a coffee shop to do some work, so when I saw the first passenger\\'s drop-off spot -- about 10 minutes before my estimated drop-off spot -- was near another coffee shop, I got out there -- this means  got out at exactly the same time as the other Pool passenger, and -- to repeat myself -- his drop-off spot was \\\\*ahead\\\\* of my drop-off spot by about 10 minutes.\\n\\nI rated the driver five stars, saw that it was the $2.35 fare (I have a 50% off for the week), and closed the app. Well, then I opened the app again and saw that I was charged $3.48 for the ride -- far above the estimated $2.35 price with discount.\\n\\nI contacted Uber via the app and they asked for my pick-up and drop-off spots, which I provided, noting that I got out at the same time as another passenger whose drop-off was ahead of mine.\\n\\nWell, after the back and forth, Uber gave me $3 Uber Cash, but they still blamed me for not getting out at the final destination -- despite my \\\\*getting out earlier than the original destination at the same time as another Pool passenger\\\\* -- freeing the driver of about 10-15 minutes of  additional driving.\\n\\nFrankly, I didn\\'t want $3 of Uber Cash.

I decided to repost because I believe that it does need to be said and heard.)\\n\\nI joined this sub when I started doing Lyft full time 7 months ago. I was so excited and thrilled to be doing it! It was incredible being on my own time and schedule. I really looked forward to going out and driving. After around a few weeks of lurking around this sub, the whole job got a really sour taste in my mouth. I started going out later and coming home earlier. I started to look at nothing but the negative side of the job. I started taking an extra day off in the week. I sat and really started to wonder if I enjoyed it as much as I thought. \\n\\nI soon had a realization that the community in the sub was the reason for the totally different output I had. I didn’t even realize that reading post after post all day from people cutting the job down and bitching in general, subconsciously totally shifted my feelings. I picked up a job during the holidays and picked back up doing Lyft in full swing a month ago. Since I started, I haven’t been looking at this sub nearly as much as I used to. When you are surrounded by constant negativity, it’s super hard to have any sort of positive outlook at that thing. \\n\\nI just wanted to leave this post here for anyone who may need to hear it, so here it is:\\n\\nI make $150 every day I work, which is plenty for my cost of living plus a second income from fiancée. It also equals out to me making in one week what I used to make in two. I work five days a week.  I choose to work late mornings to late afternoons. Even though every market is different, it’s important to realize that people are always needing rides. There’s always this really big myth, and even drivers will say it too, that you can only make real money at night in the city. And even though there is money to be made at night, there’s also plenty of money to be made in the afternoon as well. I personally like being home at night and also not a big fan of the crowd rideshare brings out later in the night. \\n\\nI have a 5 star rating with hundreds and hundreds of rides completed. Also, almost every single rider leaves me a tip. I usually receive very good tips very often. It is completely not unusually for me to receive tips higher than I made off of the ride percentage. That’s not because Lyft is out to get me like every member of this sub tries to make you believe. It’s because I have a legitimate personality that people enjoy. I always see other drivers and they look miserable. I also always see drivers out cleaning their cars between rides at the airport. I always chuckle at them! The secret to getting a good tip and a good rating isn’t having shiny tires! You have to very quickly, at almost an immediate pace, learn your passenger. Once you learn what type of passenger you have, play off that and you’ll be fine. No one cares about phone chargers, or free water and chips, or an aux cord for the passenger, or all this other BS they try to tell you. In almost 500 rides, I’ve been asked for a phone charger exactly 2 times. \\n\\nAbove all, I enjoy the job. For me, there are way more perks than negatives. I truly believe that the same miserable drivers I see every day with zero personality, are the same type of people posting negative things constantly on here. The job is a blast and you absolutely can make money and get lots of tips. Of course, not every driver has a constant flow of rides coming their way. I will agree that it is very challenging to make real money in a town. But if you live in a city, you have no reason to not be bringing home what you need to bring home every week. \\n\\nThe job isn’t terrible. Don’t let strangers potentially take away your spirit or drive for something you enjoy or look forward to starting. Best of luck of there. \\n\\nEdit: Here’s some screenshot proof: https://imgur.com/a/DAbBydj/',\n",

After getting my excessive amounts of luggage (I’m moving across the country) onto a cart and out of the room, I locked my phone in the hotel room. It was only then that I discovered this hotel didn’t have a 24 hour front desk. I couldn’t get back in my room and my phone, with the ride already called, was locked inside. I knew I had someone who would pick it up and mail it to me, so the biggest concern was the Lyft.\\n\\nThrough the side door of the hotel, we see the car drive by and go to the hotel gates, so we start toward the front of the hotel. No car. Turns out the Lyft couldn’t get in. The gates needed someone at the front desk to let people in without a room key. By the time we figure this out and run the stuff back to the side door by the gate, we just manage to flag down the driver as he’s leaving. He helps with our bags in the rain, drives us the 5 minutes to the airport, and we go on with our day. \\n\\nWhen I get my phone back and open Lyft hoping to give the man a solid tip for being so helpful, I find out that he cancelled the ride when he gave up at the gate. I want to send a message to Lyft to correct it and charge me the full amount (and ideally still be able to leave a tip and a good review and any additional praise I could send to Lyft that could possibly benefit him), but I don’t want to risk getting the man in trouble if he wasn’t supposed to be driving me “off the clock.” I’m not sure how applicable that is to Lyft drivers.  Any advice on the best way to proceed?\\n\\nTLDR: really nice driver took us (and our luggage) in the rain despite having already cancelled our route and I want to get him his money and any kudos possible without getting him in trouble for being “off the clock.”',\n",

(They’re  in a wheelchair) \\nThe ride was about 35 min long and throughout the ride the smell became pungent and I had to keep the window cracked. It was a cold night but there was no way I could hotbox with that deadly smell.    I drove as quickly as I could and got passenger  out as fast as possible.  It wasn’t until passenger  left that the smell just exploded into the air and I LOST IT! I made it 3 houses down and i had to open the door and i just started puking in the middle of the street. Still strapped in my seatbelt, leaned out and lifting it go.  This was a God awful smell and i was gagging, tearing, puking. Temperature outside was in the 30’s and probably felt like 20’s.  I had to drive with all 4 windows down to try to air out the car.  I sprayed  in the car but the stench didn’t flinch.  I turned on the light and saw my seat was wet. Not drenched but it had spots where either some sort of adult diaper leaked or This passenger was super moist with funk. Either way their ass juice was penetrating into my cloth seat and I was losing my mind because my vehicle is less than 2 years old 😭. So I take pictures of the seat and send them into lyft and explain my entire experience and they tell me to resend my photos so they can assess the situation and determine what I should be compensated. When I got home I cleaned my seat soooo dang well that the smell is completely gone.  I used a few household products, dog urine odor spray, and bath and body works concentrated room spray.  It took me a while to scrub and soak and then absorb with towels and repeat to finally get the smell out. I left the windows down and let the vehicle air out in the garage overnight. Luckily the smell is gone and no one would’ve even suspected anything happened in there.  \\n\\nLyft gave me $100 for the damage and said to submit a receipt within 24 hrs or this would hurt my chances of claiming damages in the future.  I let them know in my original complaint/ email that I would try to clean seat and get the smell out but if I couldn’t then I would have to have it professionally cleaned.

It was a thread of 15 automated messages with each one saying the same thing more or less\\n\\nI called an Uber and during the chat with the driver, I learned he told me he lived in my condo building. After getting home, I noticed that I left my umbrella in his car. I knew of the lost item fee from Uber about returning the item and I did not want my umbrella back if I had to pay that. I am on a student budget and my umbrella was not worth the $15.\\n\\nUber has a standardized message before they connect you with the driver regarding the lost item saying you can be charged $15. This fee would not apply if the item is returned to a police station or to one of Uber's designated hubs. \\n\\nSo before being connected to speak with the driver through the Uber phone relay, you accept a disclaimer that you may be charged for the return of the item, espeically if the driver has to travel somewhere or stop accepting rides. I spoke with the driver and said that I don't want this fee charged and if he can return the item when he gets to the building. He said that of course this would be fine and even named the concierge person by name that we both know. The agreement was that he would return the umbrella after finishing work to drop it off at the desk before he stepped into the elevator and returned home.\\n\\nAfter he did this, he said that he will give me the $15 back. This was before the holidays and I got in touch with him after the holidays. He told me he moved since then and we were tyring to figure out how to get the $15 back. He then came to the conclusion that he will cotnact Uber and let them know to refund this back to my credit card. He said not to worry and that he assures me this will be taken care of and the refund would be made. \\n\\nI contacted Uber and there was a thread if 5 automated responses that they will not refund the fee, even after I went into detail with what the driver requested. I kept on receiving the same automated response from Uber. \\n\\nI got in touch with the driver and he told me that he already contacted Uber regarding this. I got in touch with Uber and they were sending me the same automated reply.\\n\\nIt was a series of about 15 automated replies from Uber, each one failing to address the details of what I was asking for. I asked them if they have a record from the driver and each time, they refuse to look into this further.\\n\\nI tried cotnacting my credit card company and I was told that I would need something in writing from the driver. I can;t get in touch with the driver anymore as he's not responding to a few voicemails.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nThe agreement was before he returned the lost item, that I would not be charged for this, since we lived at the same location.\\n\\nThe agreement was broken and I was scammed in the end. Uber is refusing to look into it and if they did, they would know that we lived at the same address. Also, the drive told me he already cotnacted Uber to reguest the refund to be put back on my credit card.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nWhat to do?!\",\n",

This functionality should be adhoc and queued by the Passenger when he/she feels unsafe, travelling alone, in an unsafe location when booking a ride. This functionality is **not** present on all rides and only prompted to both the Driver (upon pickup) and by the Passenger when the Passenger requests 'enhanced verification' when booking their ride in the Uber app.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Solution:** The Uber App (kind of like two-factor authentication) will generate a passphrase only visible to the Driver and Passenger, something like 'Toasted Walnuts' (a randomly generated phrase or saying). The passenger when entering the vehicle should verify 1. Driver's name, 2. Tag number, 3. Request the pass-phrase from Driver. If generated pass-phrase is not provided or is incorrect, Uber passengers should not enter vehicle as this does not pass their requested 'enhanced verification' needs.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\n**Benefits:** This provides added security for the passenger as a way to verify their driver. Adds security for the Driver to ensure they are picking up the right individual (danger is a two-way street). \\n\\nProvides Uber a tracking mechanism to begin trending: 1. Where is the volume of 'unsafe' or 'potentially unsafe' requests are coming from in any given geographical area and more importantly at what time, 2. Increased Passenger/Driver protection functionality, 3. Proactive gauge on Drivers who 'cancel' or 'reject' Enhanced Verification Rides. 4. Maybe: Enhanced Verification rides for Uber's top drivers by rating, # of rides (developed trust).\\n\\n\\\\-- I can only imagine that if this functionality was in place, it would provide an added measure of security to the women of this world who rely on Uber (thank you) but also need to know the Driver they are getting in the car with is a safe, reputable, trustable Uber driver.\",\n",

       " 'Would you ditch Uber/Lyft ifThere’s an investor on the fence about investing a modest amount of money for me to start a company similar to Uber/UberEats. I have talked to small businesses and corporate and they are all willing to ditch Uber and similar platforms like Grubhub. \\n\\nI am planning on starving both companies of drivers by paying 2-3x more on a per ride basis while getting rid of most thrills like discounts. The biggest issue is I need to know the fastest and cheapest way to tell other drivers and have them sign up for no sign on bonus (I’m not made of billions of investor money here).\\n\\nUltimately I think drivers are the most important part of the puzzle yet customers are greasy as God’s. If I own a monopoly on drivers, my theory is I can jack up rates and customers will have no choice. If I pay drivers more, they will be more loyal to me and won’t ditch me even if Uber and Lyft increase prices, because they know those companies don’t care about them. The plan is to raise $5 million for a SuperBowl commercial to hook drivers and tell riders come tomorrow morning, all the rideshare drivers are moving over to this app so if you want a ride, you need to download this app. The commercial would also call for drivers to delete both Uber and Lyft from their phones. This will draw free press. It’s crucial that a significant amount of drivers switch at the same time otherwise I will run out of money. This company in a way will be the drivers union, guarding against predatory actions. If I can hold a monopoly on drivers, I then theoretically can starve the others into deep loses. Lyft should fall first since it has basically no other revenue stream and relies entirely on the US market. Uber will have enough cash on hand to hold out but as long as drivers don’t defect, they will fall a year or two later. Uber may in a last gulp of air, throw all its money into autonomous cars. \\n\\nThis company will be lean, no expensive self driving car research, no ridiculous executive compensation.

The speed created a vomit tornado in my car. It got everywhere including my face and hair. I made the decision to finish the ride because I was worried for the pax's safety due to the cold. I was obviously unhappy about the situation, but I wasn't filled with anger. I was just sad. I drop the pax off and he says he's embarrased and he'll make it up to me. He hands me a twenty. He then says I have a hundred but I dont think this is worth it. I roll my eyes. I spent at least 6 hours cleaning, including going into walmart with puke on me to get cleaning supplies. After all of this I was mad at myself for not getting mad and staying calm the whole time. I realized this is why I never can seem to get ahead in life.

       " 'We are ALL getting #liftedbylyftHi All,\\n\\nAs a former Lyft driver and current Lyft rider, I have some massive grievances with the illegal pricing tactics used by the company. Today, in the mail, I received my $3 and change for the settlement of a Lyft Class Action Lawsuit which had them admitting to price fixing and robbing drivers of 100% of their primetime fares.\\n\\nI realized that drivers were being cheated when I drove on New Years and happened to ask my riders what they were paying for their rides, and soon saw that i wasn\\'t making anywhere near my 75% commission (even after factoring in the Los Angeles city fees of $2.10 put on top of every ride).\\n\\n# I made $23.97 on a $36.38 ride, a dismal 65% commission. (Ride #23 in picture below)\\n\\nOver a year ago, I spoke and met with many of Los Angeles\\' top lawyers directly because of the evidence I have that supports the nationwide lawsuit against Lyft that was filed in New Jersey for Price Fixing and cheating their drivers out of their hard-earned pay ([https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/business/Lyft-Drivers-Say-Theyre-Getting-Shortchanged-by-the-Company-468282433.html?amp=y](https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/business/Lyft-Drivers-Say-Theyre-Getting-Shortchanged-by-the-Company-468282433.html?amp=y)) + ([https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Fare-Fraud-Lyft-Drivers-Say-Theyre-Getting-Shortchanged-by-the-Company-465572743.html?amp=y](https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Fare-Fraud-Lyft-Drivers-Say-Theyre-Getting-Shortchanged-by-the-Company-465572743.html?amp=y)).\\n\\nUnfortunately, no one in California wanted to take on the big ride-sharing giant because New jersey was already trying to.\\n\\nUnfortunately for this lawsuit though, it fell massively short because it only covered drivers that opted out of the Lyft user agreement within their first few months of use (aka .0001% of drivers), and left out the rest of the 99.99% of US.\\n\\nMy question to the Lyft and Reddit communities is why hasn\\'t ANYONE heard about any of this?\\n\\nWhy hasn\\'t LYFT taken any hit for this in the media and news?\\n\\nWhy hasn\\'t a NATIONAL, FEDERAL TRIAL taken place to investigate every single transaction that Lyft has ever done to ensure that they haven\\'t been penny-shaving on each and every one of them? We are talking about billions of transactions where they can be shaving pennies or even dollars!\\n\\nI contacted the city attorney\\'s office directly. They said they were going to try and do something about it and that they know about it. Nothing happened.\\n\\nSo here I am, reporting the data myself for the reddit community to see.\\n\\nBelow you will find an image of 30 rides, tallied up using Data that both I was given in the app (Total driver earned APP column) and Data that a Lyft customer service representative gave me under a legal recording (total passenger pay ACTUAL column).\\n\\nIf any of you try to ask Lyft what your passenger paid for their ride, they wont tell you. And we know the reason why. It took 10 customer service calls for one employee to literally go through each of these 30 rides and tell me EXACTLY what the passenger paid. After telling him what I got paid and doing the appropriate math with him, needless to say, he was perplexed and in awe. He had no explanation for where the extra dollars and pennies went after we factored out the $2.10 Safety and Transportation fees that the company collects in Los Angeles. I wasn\\'t making 25% on this leftover amount, and it was going straight to the company on every single transaction.\\n\\n**So here is a key for you all for the table below:**\\n\\n**Grey Column:** Taken straight from the APP\\n\\n**Green:** ACTUAL DATA from either the APP or the LYFT EMPLOYEE)\\n\\n**Beige:** What we, as drivers, are shown to believe what a Rider pays (ride payments+ lyft fee + prime + tips). This amount lets us see the LYFT percent-take-away as 25% quickly and leaves us happy as drivers.\\n\\n**Red:** The discrepancy between what the customer actually paid and what i am shown/assumed to believe he paid.\\n\\n**Yellow:** After factoring out the $2.10 imposed on every ride. Positive values indicate money that Lyft has pocketed. Negative values are rides where the rider \"underpaid\" and Lyft\\'s cut was less than usual.\\n\\nYou will see many positive values in the yellow column going all the way up to $4.72 that was pocked by the company.\\n\\n**CONCLUSION:**\\n\\n**Lyft does not have a pricing/fare schedule for its riders by the mile/minute like traditional Taxis.**\\n\\n**ONLY the drivers are contracted at a per mile &amp; minute rate, and therefore, Lyft takes the difference between what the user pays and what Lyft HAS to pay the driver.**\\n\\n**QUESTION:**\\n\\n**Who are these people that are overpaying v.s. underpaying? How does Lyft determine who will pay more for the same ride? Do they know the demographic and economic makeup of every customer to help them make that decision?**\\n\\n**Is Any of this Legal?**\\n\\n**WILL ANYONE DO ANYTHING?**\\n\\n\\\\#liftedbylyft\\n\\nPS: If anyone has any other communities you think I should post this to, please let me know, as this is my first time on Reddit and don\\'t know the ins and outs of it.\\n\\nThank you\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nEDITED:\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nFOR THOSE SAYING I DON\\'T HAVE THE PROOF THEY WANT: I don\\'t care.

       " 'Lyft Driver Uses \\'N\\' Word; Lyft Responds Swiftlytl;dr on the bottom\\n\\nI just wanted to share a personal experience my wife and I had yesterday that we thought should be made public to both remind us all that blatant racism is still very much a thing, and to commend Lyft for the manner in which they responded to what happened.\\n\\nMy wife and I were returning from vacation in Fort Lauderdale and ordered a Lyft to take us to the airport. Our driver Melinda, a middle-aged white woman, picked us up at the Westin Fort Lauderdale Beach Resort. When she arrived, she complained about us having two pieces of luggage and said we had to put one in her backseat while one of us had to sit up front. She did not want both in her trunk for some reason (even though it appeared both would fit). No big deal, so I sat up front.\\n\\nI immediately noticed that she was deviating from the GPS\\' suggested route. As her chosen route only added three minutes or so to the estimated trip, I again thought to my self, no big deal. When we got stuck in tremendous traffic, the GPS ETA increased tremendously. I suggested that she make a left hand turn per the GPS\\' suggestion and I pointed at it. She snapped at me to \"get my finger out of her face\" (it wasn\\'t close to her, but again, maybe she is having a bad day and I brushed it off). She reluctantly went left after a few more minutes of going nowhere.\\n\\nThen...it happened. As we were driving, we came upon what appeared to have been a fender bender in the left lane. A black woman got out of the passenger side of the front vehicle and began to yell at the driver of the vehicle behind her. Out of nowhere, Melinda yelled at to the woman to \"get back in your car nigger!\". My wife and I froze with shock. Before either of us could say or do anything, she proceeded to double down on her racism by saying \"I call them that when they act like that. And THAT\\'s why I didn\\'t want to go this way!\"\\n\\nA few minutes later, we were at the airport, still too shocked to absorb the event. We thought about confronting her, but thought the better of it knowing there was little that we can say or do to this walking pile of trash to make any difference whatsoever. Once checked in for our flight, we still couldn\\'t get over it, so we decided to contact Lyft and let them know of our experience.\\n\\nUpon telling our story, we were immediately transferred to their Safety department and were assured they would start an investigation and that our fare would be refunded (which we weren\\'t fishing for, but appreciated). The person we spoke to took it very seriously and promised they would get back to us.\\n\\nI knew that this would be a \"he said/she said\" situation. Even though I know what happened here, I generally do not believe anyone should lose their job over one person\\'s unproven allegations. It would be a bad overall policy that one stranger can cause another to lose their job over an allegation that cannot be proven. I just expected Lyft to investigate the driver and to document the event so that if something like this happened in the future, they could establish a history/pattern.\\n\\nWithin 24 hours, we received multiple email updates and phone calls regarding Lyft\\'s investigation. The driver\\'s account was immediately suspended pending the investigation. Lyft spoke with other passengers of this driver and carefully reviewed the comments made about the driver over her history with Lyft. In the end, their investigation revealed the driver has actually exhibited racist behavior during other trips in the past. It was clear to Lyft that this driver had committed violations of their anti-discrimination policies and as a result, have terminated her. We were repeatedly thanked for reporting it as they have no way of knowing about these sorts of things without reports. Because of our report, they were able to find others that had similar experiences with Melinda.\\n\\nWe want to publicly thank Lyft for the seriousness with which they took this. Had their investigation revealed no other incidents, we would have been satisfied simply knowing that Lyft took appropriate actions. While some may see this not a big deal and not something someone should lose their job over, we do not believe there is any room in this world for that type of behavior.

I think my dog may have stepped on my phone and accidentally triggered the app to send rides.  I have just filed disputes with PayPal and Lyft.  Will this be a problem that I disputed with both?  I was just so pissed off about this, and about having no phone help with Lyft.\\n\\nUpdate:  Lyft did give me a partial credit back for the cancellation fees.  And I was never trying to say the drivers should not get their compensation for their time—but just that the company ought to look into the ease of booking rides without going through consent steps.  Posting some images from my phone.  In addition to the errant Lyft rides, several texts with predictive text or gibberish were also sent to a few people on my phone list.\\n\\n[Gibberish texts and Lyft history](https://imgur.com/a/jXdC4Lr) ',\n",

He wouldn\\'t let me cancel the trip, but he also didn\\'t seem willing to drive me either, and it turned into a 15 minute long ordeal where he got out of his car and followed me down the street as I tried to get another ride.\\n\\n&amp;#x200B;\\n\\nSo, yesterday, after a 12 hour stressful day at work, I decided to take uber home. I work in DC, but I live out in the boonies, and metro typically takes about an hour and a half later in the evening, so I decided to splurge.\\n\\nI request a ride, driver shows up. I get in. I cheerily say hi and tell him thanks for driving me out to Rockville.\\n\\nAs soon as I say this he stops, pulls over by the side of the road, looks at the trip on his app, and says.\"Rockville? There is a problem. I only have 20 minutes.\"\\n\\nI was confused. What did he mean by this? He explained to me that he was at his max time allowed for the day, and only had 20 minutes left, and that in 20 minutes the app would shut off even if he was in the middle of a trip.\\n\\n\"Oh, okay,\" I said, \"That\\'s fine I can get another uber.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" he said, \"You put the trip through the system, it pays me automatically, no problem.\"\\n\\n\"Oh, okay,\" I said, \"If you\\'re happy continuing the trip I\\'m fine with it, too. Let\\'s go!\"\\n\\n\"No,\" he said, \"You don\\'t understand. The app shut off in 20 minutes.\"\\n\\n\"Okay...\" I said, \"But Rockville is more than 20 minutes away, are you telling me you will only drive me until the app shuts off? If so, I should get another ride...\"\\n\\n\"No!\" he said, frustrated, \"My English is not good, maybe I\\'m not explaining well. In 20 minutes the app will just shut off. I am not allowed to work more than 12 hours. See?\"\\n\\nHe showed me something on the app.\\n\\n\"I understand,\" I said, \"So you can either start driving and we can figure out the rest of the route once the app stops, or I can get out and request another ride.\"\\n\\nHe looked down and shook his head, \"You\\'re not understanding me. The app will just stop in 20 minutes.\"\\n\\nAt this point I was really confused. I\\'ve told him he can continue the trip if he wants. I\\'ve told him I can get another ride. And this circular conversation has gone on for several minutes.\\n\\n\"Well,\" I said, \"It\\'s late and I\\'d like to get home so if you\\'re not going to take me I\\'d like you to cancel the trip so I can get another ride.\"\\n\\n\"No you don\\'t understand, I can take you but my app will shut off in 20 minutes.\"\\n\\nI told him to cancel the trip, and that I was going to find another ride. He said he couldn\\'t cancel it, so I said fine I\\'ll cancel it and get a refund and got out of the car.\\n\\nAs I was walking away from the car, I canceled the trip, and put in a request for a new ride, which he picked up again. So I canceled it again. Then, suddenly there he was out of the car.\\n\\n\"Miss, miss, I drive you no worries.\"\\n\\n\"No,\" I said, \"I\\'m going to get another ride. It\\'s no big deal. I\\'ll find someone who has more than 20 minutes and you can spend the rest of your drive time on shorter trips.\"\\n\\n\"You don\\'t understand, can I please show you on the app?\"\\n\\n\"I\\'ve seen your app, but please leave me alone so I can pick up another ride.\"\\n\\nHe kept following me down the street, telling me how I didn\\'t understand, and he wanted to drive me but he just had 20 minutes and he was not allowed to work for more than 12 hours.\\n\\nSo finally I yelled \"I get it! It\\'s late! I just want to go home I\\'ve had a long day please leave me alone so I can pick up another ride and go home. I just want to go home.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t want you to be mad at me. I just want to say sorry.\"\\n\\n\"It\\'s fine.\"\\n\\n\"I don\\'t want you to be angry.\"\\n\\n\"Okay, I\\'m not angry please leave me alone.\"\\n\\n\"I just want to say sorry.\"\\n\\n\"Oh my god I accept your apology please leave me alone now!\"\\n\\nHe finally left me alone. And I finally found a trip home.\\n\\nAnyway, has anyone heard of this max time? Does anyone have any idea why be both didn\\'t want me to leave the car, but also didn\\'t want to take my trip?',\n",

Anyway, we went down the standard quick message exchange of:\\n\\nU: \"I\\'m here\" \\n\\nM: \"Be right there\" ... \"Closing tab. I\\'ll be like 3 minutes.\" (I probably kept the dude waiting at least 5 minutes, maybe a tad longer. Honestly, I\\'d have canceled on me if I were him). \\n\\nSpoiler if you ignore parenthesis: I took longer than that by a bit...and then some. He messaged again and then called me; my phone rang pretty much the moment I walked out of the bar and the driver immediately saw me and gave a light beep. He was right in front of the bar I was at, just directly across the street. I hopped in and he goes, \"I was looking around and literally no one is on this street. You walked out of the bar and immediately were trying to answer your phone so I assumed you were my rider so I stopped the call and just beeped cause it\\'s easier\". I said, \"Thanks you made finding you really easy. My bad, that I took a bit longer than I expected.\" He said no worries, \"Despite the long weekend, it\\'s been a slow night. Neither of us seem to be in any hurry.\" (this is sunday, I left the Pats game in the third quarter I think?)\\n\\nSo now I\\'m in the car and he goes on:\\n\\nU: \"Even if this was a Saturday night at the busiest hour, since you messaged me saying you were coming, just for that, I\\'d wait a few extra minutes beyond the usual 5.

I\\'m used to people, especially those that don\\'t send some sort of message, doing that though and me then having to cancel. It happens all the time, even for people that try to be responsive, but I honestly don\\'t mind if they ghost me. I know the easy excuses for them are that DC streets can get busy, people get drunk, or it\\'s hard to find each other and ya know? But it\\'s really just not a huge deal. I know those are the easy excuses, but in my mind I hope at least the people that are responsive then ghost me do so because they found a better option for theri night.\"\\n\\nM: \"Uh... wait I\\'m not sure I get what do you mean?\"\\n\\nU: \"A better option. Anything. Maybe even a cheaper cab, I don\\'t care - I would do the same!

And around 2013 I discovered Uber.  Easily the greatest positive impact on my business travels (and ultimately personal travels) since TSA precheck (actually, can’t remember which came first). Needless to say, I’m a huge fan and for the most part, am very loyal to Uber. \\n\\nI was elated last fall when they began offer a rewards program.  However at that time something else happened.  For a reason I cannot currently explain... since November 2018 (ish), every single ride I take TO (not from) Denver International Airport - from my home - is $2-5 higher upon invoice than when estimated.   \\n\\nI’ve had the airport address listed as “work” for years now and haven’t changed a thing.  But now all the sudden every single ride comes back charging me $2-5 more than the estimate.  Proportionally more if surging.  \\n\\nIs my work paying for this?  Yes.  Is the $2-5 a huge deal?  No really.  But it REALLY irks me that this happens so consistently and even more concerning is how Uber is now responding to this issue.  \\n\\nI’ve been contacting Uber support on this since November and initially, they would quickly respond with essentially, ”We’re sorry.  Here is a credit for the difference.”  No mention of, you’re doing it wrong or, this is why this is happening.  Ok, mistakes happen.  But they’re making it right.  I can appreciate that. \\n\\nThen recently, the responses changed.  Now they respond by saying, “We’ve issued you too many credits and will no longer do so.”   \\n\\nNow wait a minute... \\n\\n1) If I’m, doing something wrong... tell me what it is and I’ll correct it.  No credit needed.  My fault.  But guide me on what my malfunction is. \\n\\nOR...\\n\\n2) If Uber is doing something wrong.... over and over and over again... why is there a “limit” for how many times they are willing to make good on the resolution?  I mean why should I be “cut off” from getting a justified credit if they haven’t fixed the issue causing it?\\n\\nThis is more of a principal thing to me.  As loyal as I’ve been to Uber, I feel slighted every time they “overcharge” me and especially now they’ve basically said, “stop asking us to fix this.”\\n\\nThanks in advance to anyone that might offer some guidance or direction in resolving this (or just enlightening me). \\n\\nTD;LR - Uber is consistently charging me more than the estimate for to-airport trips.

       " 'Uber app has a \"feature\" that is breaking the experience for riders and drivers where I live.So, this is a totally trivial detail, one would think, but I had no luck trying to get in touch with Uber, so ill leave this here.\\n\\nI\\'m in the Dominican Republic. Uber is great here. Until recently, it\\'s been cash only.... But now you can pay with your defined payment method.... Great, right?\\n\\nSo I thought.... After taking some rides recently, I noticed that it was harder to get picked up, with phantom drivers displayed that never moved, drove mysteriously around the block, and just generally took longer to show up.\\n\\nI noticed the drivers I had seemed a little miffed when I talked to them about Uber using cards now.... I quickly gathered that card customers tip much more poorly.\\n\\nTo me, this was confusing, because I assumed the opposite would be true, based on my limited experience.\\n\\nThe drivers I rode and talked with with were professional, courteous, friendly, and patient with my poor Spanish....I couldn\\'t figure out why they weren\\'t getting tipped. \\n\\nSo, pondering this, I got out of my last ride, determined to leave a tip of at least 30 percent of my ride.... And I accidently left a tip of 0.3 percent instead. \\n\\nYou see, the UI assumes that currencies here work like in the USA. They don\\'t. There are no fractional pesos. A peso is worth about 0.02usd. So when I typed in \"50\" for my tip, it left 0.50 pesos, an amount less than the smallest legal denomination by half. \\n\\nNow, people here are used to dealing in whole pesos. No one uses fractional pesos, and it won\\'t occur to anyone to type 5000 when they want to leave a 50 peso tip.... and it doesn\\'t help that in the app font, the decimal is a tiny dot lol. \\n\\nNow, with the mystery \"solved\", I asked around, and sure enough many drivers had received microscopic tips, but had no idea why. They just assumed that people paying by card tended to be comically cheap. Talking more, most had heard of some drivers pretending not to be able to find card paying riders, in order to pick up the cancelation fee.... Keeping themselves free to pick up cash riders. I\\'m not sure how they can tell the difference? Does that show up in their dashboard? It must. \\n\\nUber should fix this ASAP. It\\'s hurting drivers, and that is hurting riders. \\n\\nSo.... App developers working in a global market.... If your market doesn\\'t use fractional currency on the street, be sure to get fractional currency out of your UI.',\n",

I obliged three times but it didn’t work, and they didn’t understand the problem. Finally I got someone higher up who saw the issue was with Uber and sent it to a different team. I was very frustrated but glad someone was working on it. \\n\\nFlash forward to yesterday and I had no update after 6 days. I messaged then in the app again and a member of the Account Escalation Team replies saying they were sorry, the issue has been seen by others, and they had waved the balance and then closed the ticket. \\n\\nI tried to test this but was greeted with them same error as before. I logged another request but the person sent me back to square one asking for the credit card. I told them this wasn’t helping and asked for escalation again. I then contacted Uber support on twitter and they said they would look in to it. I was then informed by the team in the new rocket they couldn’t pay the balance, and they closed the ticket again without helping at all. In Twitter they said the same. \\n\\nI’ve now tweeted at Uber itself and logged a new request but I am at my wits end. Seemingly I cant get any consistency, and have been apparently lied to by their ‘highest customer support team’ about the balance being cleared.

       " 'Is Lyft Personal Power Zone a scam? Email I sent to LyftLink to screenshot of what it looks like\\n[Lyft personal power zone](https://imgur.com/a/zlgopRD)\\n\\nIs there any way you can revert me back to the old Prime time surge pricing? Personal power zone is a scam and barely pays anything. It’s almost as if the intent was to eliminate surges altogether or at the least reduce the amount significantly. I have a really hard time believe real, experienced (18 months+), high earning, full time drivers are actually earning more with PPZ in a non-heavily controlled environment. \\n\\nAmong the problems I have with it is, it artificially offers lower surge amounts than Prime Time. With Prime time I know where demand is (that was never an issue, so I’m confused why the app is praising itself for fixing something that wasn’t broken), I knew what the multiplier could be 100-500%, and I had more control in being able to decline trash requests with 25% surge in favor of requests with say 200% or more. \\n\\nWith Personal Power Zone, despite the app knowing what the maximum it is willing to offer you is, it doesn’t disclose that to the driver. That’s like saying go to this area because I’ll pay you more but I won’t tell you how much more, just trust me..... The app makes you wait for the power zone bonus to increase by 1-4 cents which is quite honestly a bit insulting. Why make us wait? Why not give us the max upfront? Then it locks us in the location as in we can’t leave the location or else we lose that specific bonus amount unlike with Uber. Although the app can send us requests of riders outside the zone without a bonus while we’re in it which makes absolutely no sense and defeats the entire purpose. I think it’s wrong to not apply the bonus to each individual pool passenger. Uber does. \\n\\nSince the change, my earnings have been in freefall. I generally shoot for $200-250 a day after Lyft commission fees, now I’m lucky to hit $150, and that’s because the surge is being artificially tampered with, I suspect. Comparing screenshots from this and last year, there is a huge surge difference. This Year has way less surge while last year there would be a 300-500% almost every morning. Especially when it rained or snowed unlike earlier this week when the were no surges for the majority of the day. \\n\\n\\nIf you guys are going to try to copy Uber’s feature at least try to improve upon it, instead of going backwards. What you should have done was copy Uber’s pass through rates, meaning if I driver through a surge region, I retain the rate not matter if I stay in the location or not, as long as I’m online. You should also not set the surge to a fixed dollar amount, instead opting for a percentage/multiplier. Fixed dollar surges are ONLY good for short rides, the longer and out of the way the ride is, the more the driver loses in terms of opportunity cost. Percentage/multiplier surges are good when the ride is long distance but the surge, short distance rides are only attractive if the surge is high enough, say 500%. \\n\\n\\n\\n\\n\\n',\n",

I drive in the Bay Area, CA. Most tickets have come from SanFrancisco. Believe me, I attempt to avoid picking up anyone in an unsafe or unauthorized zone. Thing is Sanfrancisco is changing zones, streets, signs and rules faster than anyone can keep up. \\nIt'd be nice of Lyft could send something out to passengers requesting that they be in a safe and authorized place for pick-up. These tickets are ridiculous to say the least. Made up my mind that the best thing for me is to stop somewhere safe and call them to walk to where I am or just cancel the ride altogether. You won't even see the person's ticketing you. Heck considering all the signs and curbs you have to read... it's just a loosing battle. City's in the Bay Area have found an abundant source of revenue. Won't be much longer before I hang it up. Poor pay and now tickets  for areas mostly only the issuers are aware of. And yeh... I know what a bus stop looks like. Also construction zones. That's the obvious. \\nFor as much money as I pay Lyft they should help drivers by being aware and communicating changes.

I go there a lot and always take Uber Pool, and also try to leave -1hr early in case other people get added to the trip. So 1hr before my appointment today, I requested a ride and was paired with Driver 1. But Driver 1 never drove towards me, and just sat in a gas station parking lot down the street for 27 minutes. I cancelled. Then I had to re-request, but by that time rush hour had hit and the price tripled. Now, because of that, I had to stick with Pool because the UberX price had become preposterous. Great.\\n\\nThen I got paired with Driver 2 (a different person), and that person was also sitting in the SAME gas station parking lot for an extended period of time without driving towards me. Then Driver 2 cancelled. Then I got paired with Driver 3, who was over 20 minutes away from my location and already driving in the opposite direction on the highway. So Driver 3 understandably cancelled. Then I got paired with Driver 4 who picked me up. \\n\\nBut Driver 4 was an asshole. \\n\\nI live in a city that can sometimes be confusing. So I had walked to a nearby building that wasn\\'t busy and easier for a driver to both find and park in front of. But my driver still passed it 3 times. Okay I understand that mistakes happen. However. Where I was located is easy to find, I was the only one standing there, I had talked to her on the phone and described exactly where I was standing and what I was wearing, and I waved as she passed every time. She made eye contact with me every time. The third time I even stood in the street off to the side, so I could step forward a little bit as she approached, but she saw me and then pulled around me and drove past. \\n\\nOn the 4th time around, Driver 4 picked me up, but before I even said hello or had my seatbelt buckled, she was complaining about my pick up spot and blaming me because one of the roads she had to drive down on the way there was missing a street sign (like that\\'s my fucking fault). She wasn\\'t yelling, but she was being curt and talking down to me. I didn\\'t respond to her. I just sat there silently. \\n\\nThen we went to pick up the next PAX, and that PAX did the same thing I did. She lives somewhere that is hard to pull into, so she walked to a nearby restaurant and requested there in an effort to make a driver\\'s job easier. We pulled into the restaurant parking lot, and you could see the PAX clearly standing there (looking down at her phone then up directly at the car, the only person outside, waving the car over, has a face that matches the profile picture). But Driver 4 still proceeded to drive in circles around this small parking lot, passing her over 6 times. I\\'m not sure what was going on in her head, because that person was clearly who she was supposed to pick up. Driver 4 was also staring at her phone without looking up at the road at all, and driving past exactly where the app was telling her to stop.  Did her brain just flatline for a few minutes? Does she not have enough experience? Was she overwhelmed by driving in the city? Was something wrong that made her act so weird? I don\\'t know. It was strange.  \\n\\nOn the 7th time around, she picked up the other PAX. Then, just like she did to me, nastily complained about the pickup location being difficult (it wasn\\'t). This PAX calmly defended herself, saying that she had actually walked to a place that was easier for an Uber driver to find and she was trying to wave her over the whole time. But the driver just cut her off dismissively, made an irritated noise, then ignored the PAX entirely. \\n\\nWe were all riding in awkward silence for a while, then out of nowhere Driver 4 loudly exclaimed that \"people like you all need to learn to use the app before you use it.\" Neither of us bothered responding. \\n\\nWhen all was said and done and I arrived at my location, 2.5 hours had passed since I tried to request my first ride. It was far more expensive than I anticipated. Also keep in mind that I had walked to another building to request, so I was just standing in front of a random hotel for most of that time.

Thoughts?When I pulled up for a ride for a woman, she texted me saying it was going to be for her husband who was trying to fill up a gas can for a scooter. I figure, okay.

The last Tuesday morning, it was really cold and I didn\\'t feel like waiting for the EL, so I checked the ride sharing apps.  The surge prices were about double ($24) what the prices are on a good day and the closest car was 9 minutes away.  I knew that Uber taxi was just the meter and a small surcharge.  I was pretty sure that it would be less than rideshare charge, and it would probably be closer, so I went with that option and there was one only 2 minutes away.  \\n\\nWhen I got out of the taxi, I checked the meter, which read an even $17.  Thinking that I made the correct decision, I walked into my office.  That\\'s when I got the notification of the receipt on my phone.  I quickly checked it and saw that a charge of $30 hit my card.  \"That doesn\\'t seem right,\" I thought to myself and checked the app, which showed the charge of $30 broken down to $28 for the fare and $2 for the \"delivery fee\".  Like I said, I knew there was going to be a surcharge, but the additional $11 dollars on the fare did not make any sense.\\n\\nI sent a request to them to look at my trip and tell me why the fare was $11 more than the meter.  This was the response:\\n\\n&gt; Hi PHWOFL,\\n\\n\\n&gt; Sorry to hear about the trouble. \\n&gt; \\n&gt; We\\'ve reviewed your trip. Because your final destination was in the suburbs, your fare reflects the City of Chicago\\'s regulations.

After the short ride, I noticed only because I checked my bank account 3 days later that I had been charged 100 dollars for \"Damage\" .  I immediately checked my e-mail and the driver had taken pictures of what looks like a coffee spill? and claimed that I had caused that damage.  I got no explanation from lyft other then the drivers\" anecdotal evidence\" pointed to my ride.  I sent in an email and all that was responded to me was \"we re-opened the case and the \"Data\" points to you\".  They did not tell me the data, nor the story the driver claimed happened.  I also can\\'t see the location or time the damage was reported and where the pictures were taken.

Trying to keep your eyes on the road, you don't process the little bit of information that Lyft sends you. I got a call earlier this month. I was in South Bend, Indiana and got a call to an street address I didn't recognize. I accepted it and drove through the bad roads to get it.  It turned out to be 19 minutes away. In all, I wasted close to an hour on this call driving there and back. And here's how the charges were split up.\\n\\n[Niles Michigan fare that cost me nearly an hour.](https://i.redd.it/rcyzhd4gggj21.jpg)\\n\\nI finish it up and head back to Indiana. Chalk it up as never do Niles again. Get another ping, Niles again, decide as long as I'm there, I'll grab it. Half way there, ride cancels, no cancel fee. (one reason why it took nearly an hour to get back to home turf) I get another ping to go to the SB airport. He cancels because I'm too far away. Another ping for Niles, but I ignore that one. Finally, as I cross back into Indiana, I get a ping 5 minutes away in South bend. Pick him up, take him to work over by the airport.  No problem. But every time I'm in South Bend, I get pings to go to Niles. I don't mind an 18 minute haul in the South Bend/Elkhart area. Usually decent fares for the trip. Niles? It's a small city where the rides don't last long. A drive of about 15 miles from where I was to pick up a passenger going 1.26 miles. Took nearly 4 times as long to pick up the pax than the ride itself. I've been suckered into two of these calls, both times the calls weren't worth the time and effort. And the bastards didn't even tip, even knowing I came a long way.\\n\\nSince Lyft refuses to let us know upfront what city the calls are in, I'll accept them on the fly, but the moment I find out that it's Niles Michigan, I cancel the ride immediately.  I don't even bother calling. Pax get pissed at Lyft: big deal. They can call Uber and pay the long pick up fee Uber charges. (Lyft doesn't have that fee, which is why pax call us) Gas prices have been on the rise again, and even with 30+ MPG, it's a major waste of gas and time for these pax. \\n\\nSo, if you're in Niles Michigan and get your call canceled on you, you can just look at why Lyft charges so little. \",\n",

I love driving for Lyft. I love driving. I’d like to think I’m always nice to my customers and provide them with a comfortable and safe ride. Well one person decided that for some reason that they either didn’t like me or that they wanted to not pay for the ride, hours after being dropped off.\\n\\nSo this person, whom I do not know, reported the ride I gave them saying that I was under the influence of drugs or intoxicated. They did this at 3:30am. I got the email reporting that my driver account was deactivated around this time. I got a follow up email from Ms. Georgia in the Trust and Safety Department at 5:30am asking when is a good time to call to address the issue. I was asleep for all of this. I wake up at 10am, go out to drive at 11am. Find out I can’t drive because of everything listed above. I write a response saying I’m available whenever and give them my number. Half an hour later Ms. Georgia calls me and just wants for me to explain my side of things.\\n\\nHere’s the truth. I am not on drugs, I do not partake in any illegal drugs. I have prescriptions for non-narcotics that do not effect my alertness or reflexes. I do not drink (funny because I live in the city where everyone gets drunk on a nightly basis). In fact the last time I drank alcohol was last year around this time for my sister’s wedding. Ms. Georgia told me she understood at that the email complaint was very vague as to how I was acting, and that after 1,600+ rides, this was my first report filed against me. She apologized for the inconvenience and reactivated my driver account. \\n\\nIt is now end of day for me.

Lyft won't refund us for the incorrect route because when we realized we were in the wrong area we decided to go home instead of to our original destination, costing us ~$50 extra.\\n\\nA couple of weeks ago my spouse and I were planning to take a ride to a store a few miles away from our apartment, go shopping, and then take another ride home. The Lyft driver we had entered the wrong address in Google Maps (ignoring the Lyft app directions) and took us in completely the wrong direction. We were about 14 miles in the wrong direction when we noticed we weren't headed the right way.\\n\\nAt that point we realized the store we wanted to go to would be closed by the time we got there, so we just changed the destination to our home address instead. Big mistake, apparently since the address was changed it means they absolutely will not refund any part of the ride. Even though the Lyft driver's mistake turned what should have been a 10 mile trip into a 30 mile trip that cost us nearly $70 (quoted price around $20).\\n\\nI understand there are probably plenty of people who write to Lyft customer support for stupid reasons and need it explained to them that you can't just add a destination and expect the price to stay the same, but that's not happened with us. I would be more than happy to pay what it would have cost to drive us \\nthe correct route, but because we can't get it adjusted we're paying easily 3x the quoted price for the driver's mistake. \\n\\nWe've been back and forth with Lyft several times and they just keep giving us the same canned response: 'I understand you were quoted a different price, but since the destination changed the price changed'. If I'd known this was going to happen I would have just let the driver take us to the closed store and called a different driver to take us home. I also don't understand why they can't look at their records to see that the driver took us in completely the wrong direction *before* we changed our destination.\\n\\nDoes anyone have advice or similar experiences?\",\n",

And the app still shows they were about a block away (at this time i was standing at my porch) and I can see the driver on the app pass my house, one block down and then make circles and parked at a near by gas station to wait fro their 8 minute timer to expire to cancel my order.  As a driver, I know there are \"loopholes\" for a lack of a better word, to make this feat possible.  Once the driver gets to a certain radius , they can say on the app the are there etc. I tired to contact for help through the app asking for a refund and got generic responses say the driver made reasonable contact and in short denied my claim.

       " 'Can anyone tell me why lyft has sucked these past few monthsI started using Uber about 3 years ago back in 2016. It was super convenient for me because at the time I was living up at college with no car. Easily took over a hundred rides throughout the course of 2 years. Never had any issues with Uber. Then I started hearing all these things about Lyft so I thought I’d download the app and cross compare between Uber to see which prices were cheaper depending on where I was going. 9/10 times it was Lyft that ended up being cheaper. Never had a problem with Lyft until around a few months ago. Ordered a Lyft (a relatively short ride, about 10 mins total). When it got to be a few blocks away the countdown started ticking that we had to be in the car. It was still a decent distance away, even if we could walk the distance it would be impossible to make it in that time. Called the driver multiple times, didn’t answer. Eventually hit with the no show fee. Great. This similar situation has happened multiple times. Then last week I had the pleasure of having someone else “steal my ride”. Long story short, ordered an Lyft. Said the guy was 4 minutes away. When he was 2 minutes away the clock started clicking that we’re departing soon. Called him, no answer. He then starts going away from our location. I thought maybe he was turning around and the GPS kept rerouting him. After rerouting 4 times I figured he wasn’t showing up. Called him again, no answer. Then all the sudden it changes to the screen to tip/rate my driver as if I’m taking a ride. He ended up picking someone else up like a mile away from where he was supposed to pick me up. I contacted Lyft right away (customer service sucks it’s all through email with is frustrating, but they are fast I’ll give them that). Ended up refunding me the money. But still. I don’t understand why I keep having these issues with Lyft. I deleted the app and will only stick with Uber because I feel that even if I have to pay extra for Uber, the service is worth it. I’m starting to think Lyft drivers are seriously underpaid because of the amount of shitty drivers I’ve encountered. It would make sense because like I said before, 9/10 times Lyft fares are cheaper. I need a drivers perspective here. I’m genuinely curious as to why Lyft drivers have been doing this lately. Is there a reason behind this? Because my friends have been running into similar problems with them too. ',\n",

Because of the texting deaths in Minnesota, they are strict about anyone touching a phone screen, so now am happy I can voice control this thing.   **Here is the harsh ticket I got, for extra money they allowed it to stay off my driving record which is good because I dont want insurance to go up on me** https://imgur.com/a/oNntLev  **Here are the screenshots of me operating the Uber with just Voice Control** https://imgur.com/a/V6fiSGA     With the voice control all objects and apps are assigned numbers, and those numbers never change, for Uber it is 8.  All I have to say is 8 to open the Uber app, and then say number 7 to hit the Go button.  The decline button will have its own number too.  This is a Google made app called Voice Access which is available free on app store.   For you iPhone guys, there may be another app that can do this too or maybe Siri can do it.    The hearing officer for my ticket said regardless of Uber, the driver must pull over to accept a ping and that cant happen on a freeway where I can cause a hazard if I pull over or in most city streets where there are parked cars and nowhere for me to pull over (especially in downtown), unless in city I pull over to gas station.  But with the voice control thing I got going, I wont need to touch or look at phone screen, I will just interact with it via voice and have it auto navigate.   Just to make back that $225 I had to drive at hours and times I didnt normally work.  So I essentially drove for free thanks to the ticket.  They are really cracking down on texting and driving and this means anyone touching their phone screen even if they are not touching, cops dont care as they will still give you ticket despite you the Uber driver just accepting a ping and not actually texting.  http://www.startribune.com/texting-while-driving-citations-in-minnesota-jump-30-percent/504803162/',\n",

When I received the a ticket via mail, I paid the fee and then submitted the receipt to Lyft. This is what they said:  I do apologize for not getting back to you sooner. Right now, I am following up on your feedback about this toll.  I appreciate you providing us with this review about this toll, however, after having looked into your account, I was not able to locate any ride given on Mar 8. 2019 around 10 AM.  Please, keep in mind that the tolls incurred during the active rides (between the pickup and drop-off locations) should be paid by the drivers and later Lyft reimburses the paid amount based on the electronic toll collection system price.  This is normally less expensive than the cash price and other payment options (such as cash, by mail, by plate, etc).  Its recommendable to pay tolls with an in-state electronic toll collection system, like FasTrak, TollTag, or EZ-Tag, because it will ensure that youre not paying additional money for tolls and then get reimbursed the correct amount.  These systems give your passengers a smooth, fast experience when going through tolls. Theyre also the safer option, as you wont be required to carry cash.  That being said, the only amount we could be able to reimburse you for these tolls is the one paid with tag/transponder.  Observe that some roadways have optional express or HOV Lanes, which charge a fee for their use. Lyft’s toll policy does not reimburse drivers or charge passengers for using these lanes.  When on a ride with a passenger, you will want to use the lanes where an additional toll is not required.  If a passenger request for you to drive in the Express Lanes, you can kindly let them know the Express Lanes are not included in the Lyft ride.  For more information about Lyfts toll policy, please visit the article on our Help Center at How tolls work for drivers.  Since were unable to reimburse for any penalty toll fees, in the case that you get a ticket, it is highly advisable reaching out to the toll authority directly to see if they can offer any help.  thank you for your understanding and your commitment to the Lyft community. Dont hesitate to email us, if you need further assistance.  See you on the road\"  The time theyre talking about is the time they sent me the ticket from EZ-Pass.',\n",

Its always a hit or miss when ordering from them as they usually forget an item or youll get a driver driving carelessly. Ive had to request a refund a few times which Ill go over below;  1. Have had a driver with a low rating that spilled our drinks (coffee, diet coke) in the bag and cursed on the way up the stairs as he realised what was happening to the bag.. he was holding the bottom of the bag before passing it to us before quickly heading away. The bag burst in my livingroom and ruined the carpets as it was literally a bag of liquids. I had to notify UberEats and sent photos of the damage and they only refunded me the drinks (we ordered about £15 worth of food which got ruined also).  2. I ordered pancakes with double sausage and a sausage mcmuffin and only received pancakes and the muffin was burnt. It cost extra to have pancakes and sausage nevermind extra sausage so I told them about this and took photos. They refunded me 40p for the extra sausage which I tried to explain to them I never received the actual sausage nevermind the extra one.   3. This time was from Subway, I ordered a foot long meatball marinara and they sent a completely different sub which I couldnt eat and they refunded me.  Now, my Grandmother (a different debit card was used) ordered a McDonalds through my app as I was visiting her and she ordered her food and told me she ordered before and stuff didnt come and I told her they can be like that. We ordered £25 worth of food and she didnt get 2 chocolate muffins which I informed UberEats about and they sent me this message, I explained to them its a different card used so Im not \"scamming\" them and they told me I would get my account deactivated. My grandmother is retired and gets money off a pension so it may not seem a lot to lose but its her money.

       " '4.76 Uber Rating- why?I cannot wrap my head around how Uber drivers rate their passengers. I just noticed my rating went down to a 4.76... I feel like I’m the ideal passenger. I’m always polite, punctual, and I always tip in cash. I have never made an Uber wait. If the driver doesn’t want to talk, I leave it at that. I had an Uber driver that needed to put air in his tire midway through our ride and I bought him a coffee while I waited. I still gave him 5 stars because I’m not a dick and I understand his job is reliant on his ratings.  It’s just frustrating that I feel I have to work so hard to please a service that I am paying for. The entire rating system is fucked. Can anyone help me understand what I need to being doing differently?',\n",

I don’t remember doing anything bad other than briefly speed a little on freeway to safely merge into a different lane to exit.   I go out of my way to be extra nice, play some good music, turn on the seat warmers, and I also tell my passengers to put their bags and items in my trunk so they can ride comfortably but they insist on a tight space just because they don’t live far. None of the passengers I’ve driven have had any negative vibes with me, if anything I get relaxed and nice passengers. The only ones I’ll complain about are the ones that smell really terrible or will eat in my car without my permission (I state this in my description clearly so I hope for riders to see this!).  I’ll get a 3 star rating occasionally for having a “dirty car” but it’s the winter time and people scuff the back of the front seats leaving streaks of mud and salt on them as well as on my doors. I’m just addressing my concerns because I’m getting two-faced riders and this is unfair. I drive well and intend to safely transport my passengers safely, my Lexus is a very smooth ride and I’m relaxed all the time when I drive but I can’t help but feel people will always be so anal about the little things (I.e dirty floor mats or just a random rating because I don’t talk a lot and I don’t because most of my passengers barely say hi let alone break the ice).   So what gives and how can I improve my rating? People are getting picked up in something super nice for cheap and they’re still ungrateful.',\n",
       " 'Irritating situation with Express Pool ride this morning: overcharged for getting out early(First, yes, I know I ordered Pool. And, yes, because of that, I know drivers hate me.)  I waited patiently for the driver to arrive after the two-minute countdown -- bizarrely he drove past me and I had to run to the car, but whatever -- and, despite the countdown to get other passengers \"going my way,\" the driver was assigned another rider whose pick-up spot was far north of my destination and his drop-off spot was far south of my destination. Almost immediately, the app noted that my arrival was going to be later than expected, probably because of the extra passengers pick-up/drop-off spots being out of the way.  Anyway, I was only taking a ride to a coffee shop to do some work, so when I saw the first passengers drop-off spot -- about 10 minutes before my estimated drop-off spot -- was near another coffee shop, I got out there -- this means  got out at exactly the same time as the other Pool passenger, and -- to repeat myself -- his drop-off spot was \\\\*ahead\\\\* of my drop-off spot by about 10 minutes.  I rated the driver five stars, saw that it was the $2.35 fare (I have a 50% off for the week), and closed the app. Well, then I opened the app again and saw that I was charged $3.48 for the ride -- far above the estimated $2.35 price with discount.  I contacted Uber via the app and they asked for my pick-up and drop-off spots, which I provided, noting that I got out at the same time as another passenger whose drop-off was ahead of mine.  Well, after the back and forth, Uber gave me $3 Uber Cash, but they still blamed me for not getting out at the final destination -- despite my \\\\*getting out earlier than the original destination at the same time as another Pool passenger\\\\* -- freeing the driver of about 10-15 minutes of  additional driving.  Frankly, I didnt want $3 of Uber Cash. I wanted to get a $1.13 refund for being overcharged. If you get out earlier on a Pool ride, at the same time as another passenger, you obviously shouldnt be charged extra. Uber is a scam a minute. ',\n",

I decided to repost because I believe that it does need to be said and heard.)  I joined this sub when I started doing Lyft full time 7 months ago. I was so excited and thrilled to be doing it! It was incredible being on my own time and schedule. I really looked forward to going out and driving. After around a few weeks of lurking around this sub, the whole job got a really sour taste in my mouth. I started going out later and coming home earlier. I started to look at nothing but the negative side of the job. I started taking an extra day off in the week. I sat and really started to wonder if I enjoyed it as much as I thought.   I soon had a realization that the community in the sub was the reason for the totally different output I had. I didn’t even realize that reading post after post all day from people cutting the job down and bitching in general, subconsciously totally shifted my feelings. I picked up a job during the holidays and picked back up doing Lyft in full swing a month ago. Since I started, I haven’t been looking at this sub nearly as much as I used to. When you are surrounded by constant negativity, it’s super hard to have any sort of positive outlook at that thing.   I just wanted to leave this post here for anyone who may need to hear it, so here it is:  I make $150 every day I work, which is plenty for my cost of living plus a second income from fiancée. It also equals out to me making in one week what I used to make in two. I work five days a week.  I choose to work late mornings to late afternoons. Even though every market is different, it’s important to realize that people are always needing rides. There’s always this really big myth, and even drivers will say it too, that you can only make real money at night in the city. And even though there is money to be made at night, there’s also plenty of money to be made in the afternoon as well. I personally like being home at night and also not a big fan of the crowd rideshare brings out later in the night.   I have a 5 star rating with hundreds and hundreds of rides completed. Also, almost every single rider leaves me a tip. I usually receive very good tips very often. It is completely not unusually for me to receive tips higher than I made off of the ride percentage. That’s not because Lyft is out to get me like every member of this sub tries to make you believe. It’s because I have a legitimate personality that people enjoy. I always see other drivers and they look miserable. I also always see drivers out cleaning their cars between rides at the airport. I always chuckle at them! The secret to getting a good tip and a good rating isn’t having shiny tires! You have to very quickly, at almost an immediate pace, learn your passenger. Once you learn what type of passenger you have, play off that and you’ll be fine. No one cares about phone chargers, or free water and chips, or an aux cord for the passenger, or all this other BS they try to tell you. In almost 500 rides, I’ve been asked for a phone charger exactly 2 times.   Above all, I enjoy the job. For me, there are way more perks than negatives. I truly believe that the same miserable drivers I see every day with zero personality, are the same type of people posting negative things constantly on here. The job is a blast and you absolutely can make money and get lots of tips. Of course, not every driver has a constant flow of rides coming their way. I will agree that it is very challenging to make real money in a town. But if you live in a city, you have no reason to not be bringing home what you need to bring home every week.   The job isn’t terrible. Don’t let strangers potentially take away your spirit or drive for something you enjoy or look forward to starting. Best of luck of there.

       " 'Dumb question inboundHey all. Not a driver, but passenger.    Long story short, my car was totaled and Ive been relying on Lyft for rides to and from work. Anyway, when requesting a Lyft, is the price you see on the screen when you confirm the ride you wind up paying?    Two reasons I ask: Friday night on my way home, the driver asked me what the nearest intersection was (???) and I told him. He then asked if that was east or west (like dude, just go where the GPS is telling you). I told him east. What does he do? Gets on the highway going west, and winds up taking the long way round the city.    Today to work, the driver was blatantly ignoring the GPS. Like to the point I was 10 minutes late to work. She started raising red flags when she said, \"I dont know why the GPS is taking me down that road.\"    \"The highways that way,\" I told her.    She blew right by the turn. \"See? Now its rerouting.\"    \"...… because you blew right by the turn.\"    \"Oh, I just dont trust these things.\"    So finally we get on the highway (after ignoring another turn and taking the longest possible way to the highway) and get close to work. As were on the exit ramp, the GPS said go straight, she turns right. Like WTF. I can tell you, so far, nothing makes me more uncomfortable as a passenger than that.    So would you guys know? Or are they trying to scam a bigger fare?    Thank you!',\n",

       " 'How to be sure a driver is fairly compensatedI’m going to give some context, but there’s a TLDR at the end.   I called a Lyft XL from my hotel to the airport at 4:30am. After getting my excessive amounts of luggage (I’m moving across the country) onto a cart and out of the room, I locked my phone in the hotel room. It was only then that I discovered this hotel didn’t have a 24 hour front desk. I couldn’t get back in my room and my phone, with the ride already called, was locked inside. I knew I had someone who would pick it up and mail it to me, so the biggest concern was the Lyft.  Through the side door of the hotel, we see the car drive by and go to the hotel gates, so we start toward the front of the hotel. No car. Turns out the Lyft couldn’t get in. The gates needed someone at the front desk to let people in without a room key. By the time we figure this out and run the stuff back to the side door by the gate, we just manage to flag down the driver as he’s leaving. He helps with our bags in the rain, drives us the 5 minutes to the airport, and we go on with our day.   When I get my phone back and open Lyft hoping to give the man a solid tip for being so helpful, I find out that he cancelled the ride when he gave up at the gate. I want to send a message to Lyft to correct it and charge me the full amount (and ideally still be able to leave a tip and a good review and any additional praise I could send to Lyft that could possibly benefit him), but I don’t want to risk getting the man in trouble if he wasn’t supposed to be driving me “off the clock.” I’m not sure how applicable that is to Lyft drivers.  Any advice on the best way to proceed?  TLDR: really nice driver took us (and our luggage) in the rain despite having already cancelled our route and I want to get him his money and any kudos possible without getting him in trouble for being “off the clock.”',\n",

Currently,  we dont have an edit/delete option for Uber desktop version. To  edit/delete the payment methods, you would have to do it from the Uber  app.    Hope this helps, have a good day.\"    Fun fact, every single email and twitter response I sent from my end pointed out the app was not an option, and it took this damn long for them to work it out and point out that no, that option doesnt exists and that I should use the app.    Suffice to say, I am done, the service was neat until this stupid ass shit occurred.

As far as I know theres no other way for me to see the username from a previous ride outside of going to the ride in your history, and attempting to give them a rating.      The situation is as follows:    I drove about 16 minutes out to pick up a passenger who had an 8.5 minute ride, and I received a \"ride adjustment\" to compensate the distance I drove to pick them up.     Yesterday, I drove 21 minutes out to pick up a passenger who had a 4.5 minute ride, and I didnt receive any \"ride adjustment\" to compensate the distance at all.     The Lyft Q&amp;A on the app says that they dont offer any perks to people who drive a long distance to pick up someone with a short ride, but Ive received the previous adjustments before, and usually the app would give me a message that says something like \"Thanks for going out of your way to pick up X\" and tell me how much extra I was getting for the long pick-up.     So, is there some way I can still see the username of the passenger from two days ago?

(They’re  in a wheelchair)  The ride was about 35 min long and throughout the ride the smell became pungent and I had to keep the window cracked. It was a cold night but there was no way I could hotbox with that deadly smell.    I drove as quickly as I could and got passenger  out as fast as possible.  It wasn’t until passenger  left that the smell just exploded into the air and I LOST IT! I made it 3 houses down and i had to open the door and i just started puking in the middle of the street. Still strapped in my seatbelt, leaned out and lifting it go.  This was a God awful smell and i was gagging, tearing, puking. Temperature outside was in the 30’s and probably felt like 20’s.  I had to drive with all 4 windows down to try to air out the car.  I sprayed  in the car but the stench didn’t flinch.  I turned on the light and saw my seat was wet. Not drenched but it had spots where either some sort of adult diaper leaked or This passenger was super moist with funk. Either way their ass juice was penetrating into my cloth seat and I was losing my mind because my vehicle is less than 2 years old 😭. So I take pictures of the seat and send them into lyft and explain my entire experience and they tell me to resend my photos so they can assess the situation and determine what I should be compensated. When I got home I cleaned my seat soooo dang well that the smell is completely gone.  I used a few household products, dog urine odor spray, and bath and body works concentrated room spray.  It took me a while to scrub and soak and then absorb with towels and repeat to finally get the smell out. I left the windows down and let the vehicle air out in the garage overnight. Luckily the smell is gone and no one would’ve even suspected anything happened in there.    Lyft gave me $100 for the damage and said to submit a receipt within 24 hrs or this would hurt my chances of claiming damages in the future.  I let them know in my original complaint/ email that I would try to clean seat and get the smell out but if I couldn’t then I would have to have it professionally cleaned.  Should I just respond with “I cleaned it myself” or go get it cleaned and submit a receipt? I totally wasn’t trying to scam anyone for $100.   P.S I haven’t driven since this incident.

Driver accepted the drive but threatened her it might not be worth the money or his time but drove off anyway. Not even a quarter of the way, officially decided it wasnt, took the next exit and dropped her off in a high criminal activity industrial area and drove off.  So my wife had a conference in Portland. She drove to her parents house from which they took her downtown. They didnt want to deal with the traffic and being late picking her up so they decide for her to take a Uber to a midway point. Her brother has had a wonderful experience with Uber down in LA, and this being her first ride thought Itll be smooth and easy. But oh no, forget that. Time for a emotional traumatic experience.  A driver sees the request and accepts it. Shows up right infront of her and helps get her luggage into the car.  But right as theyre settled, he threatened her that yes its a 38 min drive (traffic), but the request might not be worth his time and he wont make much money because of the traffic. But whatever, he decides to accept it anyway and drives off.  About 10 minutes into the trip, he officially decides it wasnt worth the effort and informs her that hes going to drop her off at the next exit. She started begging him to complete the request because shes not from the area and just wants to meet up with her parents. But he kept going till he ended up in a industrial area (later research, it has a pretty bad crime problem!!) that she was completely foreign too. Told her he \"called\" another driver, didnt help with her bags, charged the $18, and then said \"oh, so YOU need to hail another Uber\" and just completely abandoned her. She managed to find a hotel and get the address to her parents who drove the whole way to get her after a hour of traffic.

I stand by my theory that Lyft doesn’t pay for wait time, here’s why....  If you wait for a passenger for a full 5 minutes, call them as the system prompts, and are given the go-ahead for the  “passenger no-show” $5 fee applied option, obviously you select that and get paid.   On one occasion, I had a passenger call me and kindly state that they miscalculated their clocking out time at work, their boss was having them finish up a task, and told me to do what I need to do and go ahead and charge the $5. It wasn’t a massive inconvenience for me to have spent that 5 minutes there and the follow up phone call was super genuine so I selected the “Passenger said to cancel” options. It was a busy night and I sympathized with the dude who was being kept late by his boss.   No $5 fee applied.   I feel like this is a pivotal point in the argument.  Same process; 5 minute wait....follow up phone call. No compensation for waiting simply because you selected “passenger said to cancel”.   If Lyft is in fact paying drivers to wait...shouldn’t that mean that I would be compensated for that time?

This fee would not apply if the item is returned to a police station or to one of Ubers designated hubs.   So before being connected to speak with the driver through the Uber phone relay, you accept a disclaimer that you may be charged for the return of the item, espeically if the driver has to travel somewhere or stop accepting rides. I spoke with the driver and said that I dont want this fee charged and if he can return the item when he gets to the building. He said that of course this would be fine and even named the concierge person by name that we both know. The agreement was that he would return the umbrella after finishing work to drop it off at the desk before he stepped into the elevator and returned home.  After he did this, he said that he will give me the $15 back. This was before the holidays and I got in touch with him after the holidays. He told me he moved since then and we were tyring to figure out how to get the $15 back. He then came to the conclusion that he will cotnact Uber and let them know to refund this back to my credit card. He said not to worry and that he assures me this will be taken care of and the refund would be made.   I contacted Uber and there was a thread if 5 automated responses that they will not refund the fee, even after I went into detail with what the driver requested. I kept on receiving the same automated response from Uber.   I got in touch with the driver and he told me that he already contacted Uber regarding this. I got in touch with Uber and they were sending me the same automated reply.  It was a series of about 15 automated replies from Uber, each one failing to address the details of what I was asking for. I asked them if they have a record from the driver and each time, they refuse to look into this further.  I tried cotnacting my credit card company and I was told that I would need something in writing from the driver. I can;t get in touch with the driver anymore as hes not responding to a few voicemails.    The agreement was before he returned the lost item, that I would not be charged for this, since we lived at the same location.  The agreement was broken and I was scammed in the end. Uber is refusing to look into it and if they did, they would know that we lived at the same address. Also, the drive told me he already cotnacted Uber to reguest the refund to be put back on my credit card.    What to do?!',\n",

They got in my lyft and i noticed it said something that it was a shared ride or maybe the new version of the \"lyft line\"     I was expecting a nice commission because I know as a user of lyft and uber from the airport its always more expensive.    I got like $3.69 for a 10ish min trip   My next airport run (immediately after that one) was about a 25 min drive from the airport. Again same \"lyft line\" or \"lyft share\" status under the passengers name near pickup location. I was also expecting a nice little chunk of commission on this ride because Ive done similar 25-30 minute rides as a customer from the airport where I pay around 30-35$ for a lyft.      At the end of the ride I got around $9.45.      If i multiple to get an hour 9.45 \\\\* 2=18.9   and 3.69\\\\*6=22.14    Obviously thats not a very accurate portrayal, but I guess my question is ... is this normal amount of compensation for the airport runs? did the passengers select \"lyft line\" or w.e and bank on me not getting another pax to in a sense \"game the system\"     honestly the stress of going through the airport parking and helping the passengers load/unload their stuff...id rather just not do airport runs and make the same money.

So I order an uber, and cancel immediately. Then I call the driver I cancelled on and just ask if I give him cash directly if he could take me to the gym!!! I want to give this a try. UBER Is a fucking scam, and I feel for these drivers. This way, uber gets fucked, and now the passenger and driver take The W. Ima a genius. Uber can fuck themselves. cause ima just use their app, for free! and they wont get a single penny!! thank god. Let me know what you think. Instead of paying 12 dollars that uber charges, I can just give the driver 10 so I save money. Works well if you go far to like LA.  TLDR: Order über, cancel, and then just ask the driver to take you to the gym (or wherever you need to go) without using the uber app, so Uber gets no money, because their company is a fucking scam and I want to make it easier for all the drivers. let me know. This way I can just give money directly to the driver so he doesnt lose 20 percent to uber. and he gains more money for All he does.',\n",

       " 'To Solve Ubers Driver/Passenger confirmation problem.**Problem:** Passengers need an added verification step when entering a vehicle regardless of them confirming the Drivers name and Tag. This functionality should be adhoc and queued by the Passenger when he/she feels unsafe, travelling alone, in an unsafe location when booking a ride. This functionality is **not** present on all rides and only prompted to both the Driver (upon pickup) and by the Passenger when the Passenger requests enhanced verification when booking their ride in the Uber app.    **Solution:** The Uber App (kind of like two-factor authentication) will generate a passphrase only visible to the Driver and Passenger, something like Toasted Walnuts (a randomly generated phrase or saying). The passenger when entering the vehicle should verify 1. Drivers name, 2. Tag number, 3. Request the pass-phrase from Driver. If generated pass-phrase is not provided or is incorrect, Uber passengers should not enter vehicle as this does not pass their requested enhanced verification needs.    **Benefits:** This provides added security for the passenger as a way to verify their driver. Adds security for the Driver to ensure they are picking up the right individual (danger is a two-way street).   Provides Uber a tracking mechanism to begin trending: 1. Where is the volume of unsafe or potentially unsafe requests are coming from in any given geographical area and more importantly at what time, 2. Increased Passenger/Driver protection functionality, 3. Proactive gauge on Drivers who cancel or reject Enhanced Verification Rides. 4. Maybe: Enhanced Verification rides for Ubers top drivers by rating, # of rides (developed trust).  \\\\-- I can only imagine that if this functionality was in place, it would provide an added measure of security to the women of this world who rely on Uber (thank you) but also need to know the Driver they are getting in the car with is a safe, reputable, trustable Uber driver.',\n",

We are almost there when our uber says he forgot to grab his mom something and pulls over at a Safeway and runs in and says he will be 5 mins and for us to get out of the car. My girlfriend is missing a leg due to an accident and we are parked the farthest from the store entrance. (Only spot available)  I told him Id like him to drop us off at the entrance  because it is unsafe to get her across the parking lot with what we had. He refused and said the ride isnt over and we can wait by his car until he is done. WTF? My girl felt super awkward and said shed wait the 5 mins and then cancel if he wasnt there so she wouldnt have to walk herself across the lot. We brought her crutches because the store has those electric carts she can sit in and we didnt know if her wheelchair would fit in some cars. She ordered the uber and refused to report him but I am very pissed. Yes she chose to wait but a driver should have never put her in that position.

       " 'Would you ditch Uber/Lyft ifThere’s an investor on the fence about investing a modest amount of money for me to start a company similar to Uber/UberEats. I have talked to small businesses and corporate and they are all willing to ditch Uber and similar platforms like Grubhub.   I am planning on starving both companies of drivers by paying 2-3x more on a per ride basis while getting rid of most thrills like discounts. The biggest issue is I need to know the fastest and cheapest way to tell other drivers and have them sign up for no sign on bonus (I’m not made of billions of investor money here).  Ultimately I think drivers are the most important part of the puzzle yet customers are greasy as God’s. If I own a monopoly on drivers, my theory is I can jack up rates and customers will have no choice. If I pay drivers more, they will be more loyal to me and won’t ditch me even if Uber and Lyft increase prices, because they know those companies don’t care about them. The plan is to raise $5 million for a SuperBowl commercial to hook drivers and tell riders come tomorrow morning, all the rideshare drivers are moving over to this app so if you want a ride, you need to download this app. The commercial would also call for drivers to delete both Uber and Lyft from their phones. This will draw free press. It’s crucial that a significant amount of drivers switch at the same time otherwise I will run out of money. This company in a way will be the drivers union, guarding against predatory actions. If I can hold a monopoly on drivers, I then theoretically can starve the others into deep loses. Lyft should fall first since it has basically no other revenue stream and relies entirely on the US market. Uber will have enough cash on hand to hold out but as long as drivers don’t defect, they will fall a year or two later. Uber may in a last gulp of air, throw all its money into autonomous cars.   This company will be lean, no expensive self driving car research, no ridiculous executive compensation. The bulk of money will go towards operations and support.  What would it take for you to personally ditch both Uber/Lyft/Via/DoorDash/Instacart for a completely new company?   New company would offer -Legally binding clause guarantying no price cuts for 3 years unless voted on by 60% of drivers. -20% flat rideshare commission for normal drivers -10% flat commission for drivers with over 1000 rides every 3 months   Shared Ride rates Base rate: $1.50 Cancel penalty: $5 Wait time: 90 seconds Max rate: $300 Min rate: $5 Per mile: $1.20 Per min: $0.35 Scheduled cancellation: $10  Regular ride rates Base rate: $1.50 Cancel penalty: $5 Wait time: 3:30 Max rate: $400 Min rate: $5 Per mile: $1.00 Per min: $0.30 Scheduled cancellation: $10  XL ride rates Base rate: $2.00 Cancel penalty: $5 Wait time: 3:30 Max rate: $400 Min rate: $7 Per mile: $1.50 Per min: $0.40 Scheduled cancellation: $10  Lux ride rates Base rate: $3 Cancel penalty: $7 Wait time: 3:30 Max rate: $500 Min rate: $10 Per mile: $1.90 Per min: $0.45 Scheduled cancellation: $10  Black car ride rates Base rate: $5 Cancel penalty: $7 Wait time: 3:30 Max rate: $500 Min rate: $20 Per mile: $2.25 Per min: $0.65 Scheduled cancellation: $10  Black SUV ride rates Base rate: $10 Cancel penalty: $7 Wait time: 3:30 Max rate: $500 Min rate: $25 Per mile: $2.25 Per min: $0.75 Scheduled cancellation: $10   Weekly power bonus  100 rides - $70 130 rides - $250 160 rides - $310 200 rides - $450  Drivers with 90%+ Acceptance rate bonus +$20 on each power bonus tier  Damage Max $350   Rating system overhaul No more 1-5 rating.

You can set filters as to which requests to automatically accept or decline based on surge percentage. If you set your rates to high compared to other drivers, you’ll see less action. If your rates are high but your the nearest driver, rider may opt to pay it.  Long pickups Riders in remote areas or in places with less drivers can agree to pay a flat rate to attract drivers to their location as an additional incentive. For example, if the nearest driver is 30 minutes away, we will recommend the rider offer $15 as an incentive for nearby drivers to agree to pick up their request. If no one agrees, the rider can choose to up the amount until equilibrium is reached.

The speed created a vomit tornado in my car. It got everywhere including my face and hair. I made the decision to finish the ride because I was worried for the paxs safety due to the cold. I was obviously unhappy about the situation, but I wasnt filled with anger. I was just sad. I drop the pax off and he says hes embarrased and hell make it up to me. He hands me a twenty. He then says I have a hundred but I dont think this is worth it. I roll my eyes. I spent at least 6 hours cleaning, including going into walmart with puke on me to get cleaning supplies. After all of this I was mad at myself for not getting mad and staying calm the whole time. I realized this is why I never can seem to get ahead in life. All my successful family and friends would have gotten verbally angry and kicked the pax out, not giving a flip about their safety.

I really havent changed anything from before, and Ive always been polite and never made the driver wait, if anything Ive gotten better at the last part by not requesting pickups at crowded areas where I have trouble finding them but rather walking a few blocks to a less crowded area.

On January 10th I took a ride that cost $13.07 with my PayPal account, I found out the next time I went to take a ride that it didnt go through and I needed to use another payment method to pay for the trip. I used my Debit card to pay for it and it went through. I saw double charges on my bank account, one for Pinless, and one for PayPal.  I was expecting one of them to go away in the next few days, safe to say it didnt. On January 14th both payments officially posted to my bank account, so the next day I sent a message to Uber support and got this back \"It appears the issue you are experiencing is already under investigation. We appreciate your patience as we work hard to resolve this issue as soon as possible.\" So I gave it a week and on the 26th asked for updates and got this message \"Were still looking into this issue. Well be sure to check back in with you once weve got a solution. Thank you again for your understanding and patience\" So I said fine, Ill give them the time to figure this out. Fast forward to a month later I sent a message to support and got this clearly generic message \"Uber places an authorization hold at the start of every trip, including trips that are later canceled. This is a standard practice to confirm that your card has enough funds to cover the fare. Youve been charged only the actual fare of 13.07 for this trip. Since Uber has already released the hold, the authorization amount should soon be released by your bank. This typically happens within a few business days.\" Meanwhile this trip took place last month, it doesnt take an authorization hold almost 2 months to clear, Ive never had that happen before.

       " 'We are ALL getting #liftedbylyftHi All,  As a former Lyft driver and current Lyft rider, I have some massive grievances with the illegal pricing tactics used by the company. Today, in the mail, I received my $3 and change for the settlement of a Lyft Class Action Lawsuit which had them admitting to price fixing and robbing drivers of 100% of their primetime fares.  I realized that drivers were being cheated when I drove on New Years and happened to ask my riders what they were paying for their rides, and soon saw that i wasnt making anywhere near my 75% commission (even after factoring in the Los Angeles city fees of $2.10 put on top of every ride).  # I made $23.97 on a $36.38 ride, a dismal 65% commission. (Ride #23 in picture below)  Over a year ago, I spoke and met with many of Los Angeles top lawyers directly because of the evidence I have that supports the nationwide lawsuit against Lyft that was filed in New Jersey for Price Fixing and cheating their drivers out of their hard-earned pay ([https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/business/Lyft-Drivers-Say-Theyre-Getting-Shortchanged-by-the-Company-468282433.html?amp=y](https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/business/Lyft-Drivers-Say-Theyre-Getting-Shortchanged-by-the-Company-468282433.html?amp=y)) + ([https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Fare-Fraud-Lyft-Drivers-Say-Theyre-Getting-Shortchanged-by-the-Company-465572743.html?amp=y](https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Fare-Fraud-Lyft-Drivers-Say-Theyre-Getting-Shortchanged-by-the-Company-465572743.html?amp=y)).  Unfortunately, no one in California wanted to take on the big ride-sharing giant because New jersey was already trying to.  Unfortunately for this lawsuit though, it fell massively short because it only covered drivers that opted out of the Lyft user agreement within their first few months of use (aka .0001% of drivers), and left out the rest of the 99.99% of US.  My question to the Lyft and Reddit communities is why hasnt ANYONE heard about any of this?  Why hasnt LYFT taken any hit for this in the media and news?  Why hasnt a NATIONAL, FEDERAL TRIAL taken place to investigate every single transaction that Lyft has ever done to ensure that they havent been penny-shaving on each and every one of them? We are talking about billions of transactions where they can be shaving pennies or even dollars!  I contacted the city attorneys office directly. They said they were going to try and do something about it and that they know about it. Nothing happened.  So here I am, reporting the data myself for the reddit community to see.  Below you will find an image of 30 rides, tallied up using Data that both I was given in the app (Total driver earned APP column) and Data that a Lyft customer service representative gave me under a legal recording (total passenger pay ACTUAL column).  If any of you try to ask Lyft what your passenger paid for their ride, they wont tell you. And we know the reason why. It took 10 customer service calls for one employee to literally go through each of these 30 rides and tell me EXACTLY what the passenger paid. After telling him what I got paid and doing the appropriate math with him, needless to say, he was perplexed and in awe. He had no explanation for where the extra dollars and pennies went after we factored out the $2.10 Safety and Transportation fees that the company collects in Los Angeles. I wasnt making 25% on this leftover amount, and it was going straight to the company on every single transaction.  **So here is a key for you all for the table below:**  **Grey Column:** Taken straight from the APP  **Green:** ACTUAL DATA from either the APP or the LYFT EMPLOYEE)  **Beige:** What we, as drivers, are shown to believe what a Rider pays (ride payments+ lyft fee + prime + tips). This amount lets us see the LYFT percent-take-away as 25% quickly and leaves us happy as drivers.  **Red:** The discrepancy between what the customer actually paid and what i am shown/assumed to believe he paid.  **Yellow:** After factoring out the $2.10 imposed on every ride. Positive values indicate money that Lyft has pocketed. Negative values are rides where the rider \"underpaid\" and Lyfts cut was less than usual.  You will see many positive values in the yellow column going all the way up to $4.72 that was pocked by the company.  **CONCLUSION:**  **Lyft does not have a pricing/fare schedule for its riders by the mile/minute like traditional Taxis.**  **ONLY the drivers are contracted at a per mile &amp; minute rate, and therefore, Lyft takes the difference between what the user pays and what Lyft HAS to pay the driver.**  **QUESTION:**  **Who are these people that are overpaying v.s. underpaying? How does Lyft determine who will pay more for the same ride? Do they know the demographic and economic makeup of every customer to help them make that decision?**  **Is Any of this Legal?**  **WILL ANYONE DO ANYTHING?**  \\\\#liftedbylyft  PS: If anyone has any other communities you think I should post this to, please let me know, as this is my first time on Reddit and dont know the ins and outs of it.  Thank you    EDITED:    FOR THOSE SAYING I DONT HAVE THE PROOF THEY WANT: I dont care. This is the proof. EVERYTHING is admissible in court.     For those saying this is all very clear in the TOS:   So why did lyft pay out in the lawsuit? Oh its because GROSS MANIPULATORY PRACTICES VOID ANY AND ALL ToS agreements.  When you steal you lose your right to be protected by a ToS.    SO YES, they STOLE, by not BEING CLEAR and for FABRICATING the data on our screens to so that we believe in the 75% marketing tool they have used for us drivers.    # BELOW YOU WILL FIND RIDE RECEIPTS AS A PASSENGER to show to all of you SHILLS that no, LYFT makes NO attempt at being \"CLEAR\" or \"FORTHCOMING\" about what they charge.  One night i spent 3 hours and $150 of my time taking 25 rides back and forth from the same location just to prove what i was talking about.  THESE ARE TWO RIDES 10 MINUTES APART, and LYFT reports them differently to you.  SO YES- THEY HAVE LIED TO EVERY PASSENGER SIMPLY BY EVEN STATING THAT THEY PAID A LYFT FARE, let alone that one of them DOESNT even show the service fee.  AND LASTLY, i have attached the settlement resolution I obtained in the mail this week. But i guess this doesnt mean Lyft did anything wrong, right? Wake up, people.

       " 'Lyft Driver Uses N Word; Lyft Responds Swiftlytl;dr on the bottom  I just wanted to share a personal experience my wife and I had yesterday that we thought should be made public to both remind us all that blatant racism is still very much a thing, and to commend Lyft for the manner in which they responded to what happened.  My wife and I were returning from vacation in Fort Lauderdale and ordered a Lyft to take us to the airport. Our driver Melinda, a middle-aged white woman, picked us up at the Westin Fort Lauderdale Beach Resort. When she arrived, she complained about us having two pieces of luggage and said we had to put one in her backseat while one of us had to sit up front. She did not want both in her trunk for some reason (even though it appeared both would fit). No big deal, so I sat up front.  I immediately noticed that she was deviating from the GPS suggested route. As her chosen route only added three minutes or so to the estimated trip, I again thought to my self, no big deal. When we got stuck in tremendous traffic, the GPS ETA increased tremendously. I suggested that she make a left hand turn per the GPS suggestion and I pointed at it. She snapped at me to \"get my finger out of her face\" (it wasnt close to her, but again, maybe she is having a bad day and I brushed it off). She reluctantly went left after a few more minutes of going nowhere.  Then...it happened. As we were driving, we came upon what appeared to have been a fender bender in the left lane. A black woman got out of the passenger side of the front vehicle and began to yell at the driver of the vehicle behind her. Out of nowhere, Melinda yelled at to the woman to \"get back in your car nigger!\". My wife and I froze with shock. Before either of us could say or do anything, she proceeded to double down on her racism by saying \"I call them that when they act like that. And THATs why I didnt want to go this way!\"  A few minutes later, we were at the airport, still too shocked to absorb the event. We thought about confronting her, but thought the better of it knowing there was little that we can say or do to this walking pile of trash to make any difference whatsoever. Once checked in for our flight, we still couldnt get over it, so we decided to contact Lyft and let them know of our experience.  Upon telling our story, we were immediately transferred to their Safety department and were assured they would start an investigation and that our fare would be refunded (which we werent fishing for, but appreciated). The person we spoke to took it very seriously and promised they would get back to us.  I knew that this would be a \"he said/she said\" situation. Even though I know what happened here, I generally do not believe anyone should lose their job over one persons unproven allegations. It would be a bad overall policy that one stranger can cause another to lose their job over an allegation that cannot be proven. I just expected Lyft to investigate the driver and to document the event so that if something like this happened in the future, they could establish a history/pattern.  Within 24 hours, we received multiple email updates and phone calls regarding Lyfts investigation. The drivers account was immediately suspended pending the investigation. Lyft spoke with other passengers of this driver and carefully reviewed the comments made about the driver over her history with Lyft. In the end, their investigation revealed the driver has actually exhibited racist behavior during other trips in the past. It was clear to Lyft that this driver had committed violations of their anti-discrimination policies and as a result, have terminated her. We were repeatedly thanked for reporting it as they have no way of knowing about these sorts of things without reports. Because of our report, they were able to find others that had similar experiences with Melinda.  We want to publicly thank Lyft for the seriousness with which they took this. Had their investigation revealed no other incidents, we would have been satisfied simply knowing that Lyft took appropriate actions. While some may see this not a big deal and not something someone should lose their job over, we do not believe there is any room in this world for that type of behavior. Thank you Lyft.  tl;dr Lyft driver calls black woman the n word, says she calls them that when they act like that, Lyft performs immediate investigation, reveals pattern of racist behavior, terminates Lyft driver',\n",

Can the freaking executive and board members think of the drivers and increase our pay? Giving us $10K for doing 20,000 rides isnt worth it, by 20,000 rides the driver is pretty much beat down and would need a Gym or may have developed some physical/mental issues after the 20K rides mark, so $10K for all that abuse beating and low pay is hardly worth it.  Heck a government medical study said \"Every disease man can get, can start in this cab!\"  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5709044/  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4899329/  So the ones sitting in their luxury offices, working 8 hours with plenty of exercise and walking around for health are becoming millionaires overnight, but the drivers out there who are deteriorating are getting $10K for 20,000 rides.  hmmmmm sounds FARE.

He wouldnt let me cancel the trip, but he also didnt seem willing to drive me either, and it turned into a 15 minute long ordeal where he got out of his car and followed me down the street as I tried to get another ride.    So, yesterday, after a 12 hour stressful day at work, I decided to take uber home. I work in DC, but I live out in the boonies, and metro typically takes about an hour and a half later in the evening, so I decided to splurge.  I request a ride, driver shows up. I get in. I cheerily say hi and tell him thanks for driving me out to Rockville.  As soon as I say this he stops, pulls over by the side of the road, looks at the trip on his app, and says.\"Rockville? There is a problem. I only have 20 minutes.\"  I was confused. What did he mean by this? He explained to me that he was at his max time allowed for the day, and only had 20 minutes left, and that in 20 minutes the app would shut off even if he was in the middle of a trip.  \"Oh, okay,\" I said, \"Thats fine I can get another uber.\"  \"No,\" he said, \"You put the trip through the system, it pays me automatically, no problem.\"  \"Oh, okay,\" I said, \"If youre happy continuing the trip Im fine with it, too. Lets go!\"  \"No,\" he said, \"You dont understand. The app shut off in 20 minutes.\"  \"Okay...\" I said, \"But Rockville is more than 20 minutes away, are you telling me you will only drive me until the app shuts off? If so, I should get another ride...\"  \"No!\" he said, frustrated, \"My English is not good, maybe Im not explaining well. In 20 minutes the app will just shut off. I am not allowed to work more than 12 hours. See?\"  He showed me something on the app.  \"I understand,\" I said, \"So you can either start driving and we can figure out the rest of the route once the app stops, or I can get out and request another ride.\"  He looked down and shook his head, \"Youre not understanding me. The app will just stop in 20 minutes.\"  At this point I was really confused. Ive told him he can continue the trip if he wants. Ive told him I can get another ride. And this circular conversation has gone on for several minutes.  \"Well,\" I said, \"Its late and Id like to get home so if youre not going to take me Id like you to cancel the trip so I can get another ride.\"  \"No you dont understand, I can take you but my app will shut off in 20 minutes.\"  I told him to cancel the trip, and that I was going to find another ride. He said he couldnt cancel it, so I said fine Ill cancel it and get a refund and got out of the car.  As I was walking away from the car, I canceled the trip, and put in a request for a new ride, which he picked up again. So I canceled it again. Then, suddenly there he was out of the car.  \"Miss, miss, I drive you no worries.\"  \"No,\" I said, \"Im going to get another ride. Its no big deal. Ill find someone who has more than 20 minutes and you can spend the rest of your drive time on shorter trips.\"  \"You dont understand, can I please show you on the app?\"  \"Ive seen your app, but please leave me alone so I can pick up another ride.\"  He kept following me down the street, telling me how I didnt understand, and he wanted to drive me but he just had 20 minutes and he was not allowed to work for more than 12 hours.  So finally I yelled \"I get it! Its late! I just want to go home Ive had a long day please leave me alone so I can pick up another ride and go home. I just want to go home.\"  \"I dont want you to be mad at me. I just want to say sorry.\"  \"Its fine.\"  \"I dont want you to be angry.\"  \"Okay, Im not angry please leave me alone.\"  \"I just want to say sorry.\"  \"Oh my god I accept your apology please leave me alone now!\"  He finally left me alone. And I finally found a trip home.  Anyway, has anyone heard of this max time? Does anyone have any idea why be both didnt want me to leave the car, but also didnt want to take my trip?',\n",

She THEN asks us if we were religious, therefore did not know if we had found God or not). I answered I was Catholic and we had just recently gotten married in the Church. LOL not good enough for her - she practically said we were heathens. Please refer to bible for approximately a bajillion verses on how you shouldnt judge people.

This other parent didn’t have one but there is no option to cancel and say they didn’t have a car seat. So I let the five minutes time out and selected “other” reason.  Is this what you do?

So it’s not like I’m drop dead gorgeous and he can’t get enough of me.) And then he would like kinda lean over and look down at my feet. BUT IT WAS NIGHT TIME. So it was dark. Why. Why. That was so weird. I dropped him off at a hotel, and when I drove away, I looked back and he was walking towards the road? But there was nothing else around except this hotel. So so confused.

When I get there, i roll down the passenger window enough to confirm the pax. Instead of him immediately getting into the car, he stands outside smoking. Whatever I guess.  Hes probably in his 30s? Idk he looks like shit.  He gets in and I start his trip to find he is going to a bad part of town. Great.  Its a 20 minute drive and this guy is so friggin drunk. Hes YELLING about all this crazy shit and will not shut up. Mostly about violence and sexual things. (what I got out of it was that he is an alcoholic with a very small weiner.)  He keeps cursing, hes making no sense, he is obnoxious. I was trying to roll with it as to not anger him since he told me hes a veteran who has killed people and he clearly is not alright upstairs. He also said something along the lines of, if someone got in his face or pissed him off, he would send them to the hospital real fast.  Anyway, were pulling up to to his house and he notices 1 of my FOUR dashcam warning signs and FREAKS out yelling about how sneaky I am. (there are signs inside and outside the vehicle plus I verbally announced the camera..).   I wasnt sure if this dude was going to strangle me or stab me or what, but I was ready to pepper spray this dude.  But he didnt do any of that.  I stop the car and tell him to have a nice night.  But he wont get tf out!  He settles down again and starts rambling about some other random stupid shit so I tell him again have a great night.  The car goes completely silence for a few long creepy moments then he says \"I dont want to get anyones hopes up but can I get your number?\"  I just blankly stared at him and started laughing.

       " 'Done with Shared (and a question)So shared sucks. I dont like doing them, seems like quite a few drivers here also dont like them. The people that make the free will decision of willingly, knowingly, and intentionally going out of their way to open the Lyft app on their cellular device, using their fingers to punch in their destination, and of their own volition selecting the shared ride option which they are under no obligation to do so, also dont seem to like shared rides either. No one wins.  Request shared ride.  Shows up with a passenger or two in the car.  Pikachu :O face.  Every. Single. Time.  Last night was the final straw. I had decided since Monday I wasnt going to do shared rides anymore, but I do very little driving Monday-Wednesday. Yesterday I rejected every shared ride. I got a regular Lyft to a nearby town that had just hosted a sports game, so those bonuses were nice, decided to stick around. My habit right now is to enable last ride each trip and then enabling driver mode once the trip is done so no shared rides get added to my queue. Unfortunately after picking up the second person it slipped my mind and I got a shared ride added. Whatever, lets just do this.  First guy was one block away from the pin.  Second woman got on with no problem  Third guy  hails a +1. I pull up to his run down roach motel surrounded in chain link fences and barbed wire, and walks straight to my window. He is with his kid and 3 large bags telling me to cancel the ride because Im \"supposed to have room\". I offer him the trunk, he refuses. I tell him to cancel the ride and request a regular Lyft, he refuses, saying he shouldnt be the one to have to cancel his Lyft because I dont have enough room. I just no-showed his royal highness. If he has a problem with that he can contact Lyft, I have his profound and deep logic on dashcam.  That gets me to my questions, is there a more efficient way of going about this? Without straight up cancelling rides, is there a way to decline rides added to your queue? I only intend to decline shared rides. Is there a way to never even be given the request for a shared ride? My acceptance rate ha taken a nose dive but I recently learned that declines and cancellation are different so I suddenly dont care at all about acceptance rates. Losing my sanity is not worth the pocket change that shared pays.',\n",
       " 'Is there a way for me to give Uber some quick extra feedback on a driver that I think deserves more than a nebulous 5 star rating?I gave the driver a 5 star and nice tip, but I kinda wanted to explain this rating and give a bit more context. Is that even possible in their system?  TL;DR: if the rating scale went to 6; this driver is the only one Ive ever had that deserves it. I just want to give the praise where its due.   The shortest version of the whole story is I ordered an uber while in line for bar bathroom and still had to close a tab; knowing this would take a few minutes, I tried to order ahead and time it right. Except whoops, turned out it was not minutes - the dude who responded was literally (not figuratively) 30 seconds down the street. When I break out quotes in a moment, know that 1: The idea behind it is more important*** because (1.1) the longer they go, the more probable its further from an exact quote,  and 2: Ill abbreviate myself as M and driver as U. Anyway, we went down the standard quick message exchange of:  U: \"Im here\"   M: \"Be right there\" ... \"Closing tab. Ill be like 3 minutes.\" (I probably kept the dude waiting at least 5 minutes, maybe a tad longer. Honestly, Id have canceled on me if I were him).   Spoiler if you ignore parenthesis: I took longer than that by a bit...and then some. He messaged again and then called me; my phone rang pretty much the moment I walked out of the bar and the driver immediately saw me and gave a light beep. He was right in front of the bar I was at, just directly across the street. I hopped in and he goes, \"I was looking around and literally no one is on this street. You walked out of the bar and immediately were trying to answer your phone so I assumed you were my rider so I stopped the call and just beeped cause its easier\". I said, \"Thanks you made finding you really easy. My bad, that I took a bit longer than I expected.\" He said no worries, \"Despite the long weekend, its been a slow night. Neither of us seem to be in any hurry.\" (this is sunday, I left the Pats game in the third quarter I think?)  So now Im in the car and he goes on:  U: \"Even if this was a Saturday night at the busiest hour, since you messaged me saying you were coming, just for that, Id wait a few extra minutes beyond the usual 5. I dont want to leave a rider who was responsive hanging, even if it means I have to keep waiting a few minutes while you find me.\"  M: \"Well thats nice. Thanks for that benefit of the doubt, I hope I didnt push that very far.\"  U: \"Its okay, you definitely didnt. Im used to people, especially those that dont send some sort of message, doing that though and me then having to cancel. It happens all the time, even for people that try to be responsive, but I honestly dont mind if they ghost me. I know the easy excuses for them are that DC streets can get busy, people get drunk, or its hard to find each other and ya know? But its really just not a huge deal. I know those are the easy excuses, but in my mind I hope at least the people that are responsive then ghost me do so because they found a better option for theri night.\"  M: \"Uh... wait Im not sure I get what do you mean?\"  U: \"A better option. Anything. Maybe even a cheaper cab, I dont care - I would do the same! But I really hope that the better option is something like, on their way out, they ran into an old friend and wanted to reconnect; or they met someone they really hit it off with, romantically speaking - and these are now more important than getting in my uber.   I know these things are rare, but theyre not unheard of...I just really hope that that type of thing is a bit unheard of to me because thats what my rider is doing when they dodge me. Or just in general that they found anything that they find more important than spending 15 minutes in the back seat of my car.\"   M: \". . . .  Ww  . .  . . Damn, thats one of the nicest things Ive ever heard anyone say\"  U: \"Thank you for saying that\"   His thoughts and this brief back and forth left an impression on me. And now that its after the fact, it *really* clicked in my head that I almost fell into that group of MIA riders to the point I nearly felt guilty by not actually being one of them and sitting in the back of his uber, but really sitting in the back of his uber for 15 or so minutes and also mostly just for hearing his train of thought on the uber rider ghosting driver issue, it was absolutely worth it.   The rest was good, unrelated convo from there. I gave the driver an instant 5 stars and added a nice tip on. Ive done all that before of course, but I really felt compelled to call out this uber drivers sincere kindness somewhere. If theres a better option for extra positive feedback for an uber drvier than this, let me know.      &amp;nbsp;   That kinda wasnt very short...sorry.',\n",

I spoke with driver support and was guaranteed to receive the bonus for several reasons, but most notably the first ride request I received on Sunday cancelled because it took me longer to get to the passenger the estimated. The exit I was supposed to take was closed, so I was forced to go to the next exit. By the time I got turned around, the ride was cancelled.    I also sat in the airport que for way to long on Monday morning becasue I received a text from Lyft saying to leave the staging area and that I would get a Lyft request on the way.

       " 'Seeking advice on how to get customer service traction on consistently repeated fares being higher than the estimate.First, I travel a lot for work. Too much.  And around 2013 I discovered Uber.  Easily the greatest positive impact on my business travels (and ultimately personal travels) since TSA precheck (actually, can’t remember which came first). Needless to say, I’m a huge fan and for the most part, am very loyal to Uber.   I was elated last fall when they began offer a rewards program.  However at that time something else happened.  For a reason I cannot currently explain... since November 2018 (ish), every single ride I take TO (not from) Denver International Airport - from my home - is $2-5 higher upon invoice than when estimated.     I’ve had the airport address listed as “work” for years now and haven’t changed a thing.  But now all the sudden every single ride comes back charging me $2-5 more than the estimate.  Proportionally more if surging.    Is my work paying for this?  Yes.  Is the $2-5 a huge deal?  No really.  But it REALLY irks me that this happens so consistently and even more concerning is how Uber is now responding to this issue.    I’ve been contacting Uber support on this since November and initially, they would quickly respond with essentially, ”We’re sorry.  Here is a credit for the difference.”  No mention of, you’re doing it wrong or, this is why this is happening.  Ok, mistakes happen.  But they’re making it right.  I can appreciate that.   Then recently, the responses changed.  Now they respond by saying, “We’ve issued you too many credits and will no longer do so.”     Now wait a minute...   1) If I’m, doing something wrong... tell me what it is and I’ll correct it.  No credit needed.  My fault.  But guide me on what my malfunction is.   OR...  2) If Uber is doing something wrong.... over and over and over again... why is there a “limit” for how many times they are willing to make good on the resolution?  I mean why should I be “cut off” from getting a justified credit if they haven’t fixed the issue causing it?  This is more of a principal thing to me.  As loyal as I’ve been to Uber, I feel slighted every time they “overcharge” me and especially now they’ve basically said, “stop asking us to fix this.”  Thanks in advance to anyone that might offer some guidance or direction in resolving this (or just enlightening me).

With Freebird, the estimate was $5.50, with the Uber app, $3.55 (I normalized estimates using the subtotal, sans discounts, since both fares should have technically been $0.00).

Before ordering my ride I placed all my luggage at my curb, and waited outside until my driver was there so they didnt have to wait for me.  First thing was the driver stopped four houses short of my house (and where I placed the pickup marker). I had to wave him down frantically before my timer ran out. Then as we were getting on the highway at the North/south split (while I was looking at my flight info on my phone) he went the wrong way. Completely against the phone directions. We went 15 min out of our way to turn around but he added another 15 by missing more directions. After the third set of missed directions (I was giving him the benefit of the doubt, some directions were like cut across five Lanes of traffic right now) I started to tell him where to go. This caused him to brake compeltely on the on ramp to the highway to listen to me. He nearly took the wrong directions every time but Im now 30 min behind on my original trip which was supposed to take 33 min. So now its over an hour to get to the airport.

TLDR: We win a $300 gift card for Uber Eats, try to use it with a new account and Uber immediately bans us for fraud, refuses to tell us why and has basically stolen $300 from us.  Full story: So, my father in law won a tailgate party pack from an online contest offered being held by Highland Park Whiskey: [http://goout365.com/highlandparktailgate](http://goout365.com/highlandparktailgate)  That contest in particular. Its pretty cool, we got Highland Park stuff and a $300 gift card for Uber Eats. Downside is we get it in the mail the day after the Superbowl, but whatever we can still get food! My FiL has never used Uber and isnt a big tech guy, so we set up a new Uber account and activate the gift card for him.  The gift card works, we have a $300 credit in the app showing. We add a credit card and verify the email. Then we try to place our order. Heres where things get funky- the app lets us go all the way to the end of the order process and then says the order is invalid. So I restart the app, thinking maybe something just went wrong. As soon as I go to log back in, the app tells me that the account is disabled. WTF? It also gives me a link to request re-activation.  I follow the link and submit the info, and within like 20 minutes I get a reply saying the account was accidentally flagged for fraud but its back up. Okay, cool. I am able to log back in, so I do the whole order over, and try to place it. Same error code. Account disabled.  I send ANOTHER email. Get another response, says the same thing. Accidental flag. Try again. Can log in, try order, order invalid. Submit another email. No response now.  So this all happened last night. This morning we get an email from Uber that says that our account has been suspended and will not be re-activated. So were out $300, and apparently theres no support number I can call to try to get this figured out.  So thanks Uber, hope you enjoy that $300.

Im in the Dominican Republic. Uber is great here. Until recently, its been cash only.... But now you can pay with your defined payment method.... Great, right?  So I thought.... After taking some rides recently, I noticed that it was harder to get picked up, with phantom drivers displayed that never moved, drove mysteriously around the block, and just generally took longer to show up.  I noticed the drivers I had seemed a little miffed when I talked to them about Uber using cards now.... I quickly gathered that card customers tip much more poorly.  To me, this was confusing, because I assumed the opposite would be true, based on my limited experience.  The drivers I rode and talked with with were professional, courteous, friendly, and patient with my poor Spanish....I couldnt figure out why they werent getting tipped.   So, pondering this, I got out of my last ride, determined to leave a tip of at least 30 percent of my ride.... And I accidently left a tip of 0.3 percent instead.   You see, the UI assumes that currencies here work like in the USA. They dont. There are no fractional pesos. A peso is worth about 0.02usd. So when I typed in \"50\" for my tip, it left 0.50 pesos, an amount less than the smallest legal denomination by half.   Now, people here are used to dealing in whole pesos. No one uses fractional pesos, and it wont occur to anyone to type 5000 when they want to leave a 50 peso tip.... and it doesnt help that in the app font, the decimal is a tiny dot lol.   Now, with the mystery \"solved\", I asked around, and sure enough many drivers had received microscopic tips, but had no idea why. They just assumed that people paying by card tended to be comically cheap. Talking more, most had heard of some drivers pretending not to be able to find card paying riders, in order to pick up the cancelation fee.... Keeping themselves free to pick up cash riders. Im not sure how they can tell the difference? Does that show up in their dashboard? It must.   Uber should fix this ASAP. Its hurting drivers, and that is hurting riders.   So....

       " 'Lyft SCAM **MUST READ**I stated below on March 3rd 2019 and I finally heard back from Lyft after contacting them via Twitter and via email. It took 4 days to hear back from them.  Scroll down.  \"On March 3, 2019 I only drove 1 passenger. I picked up a passenger named E at 3:04PM from Fredericksburg. E requested to go from Fredericksburg to Culpeper and from Culpeper to Baltimore,MD and from Baltimore, MD to Fredericksburg, VA. The distance from Fredericksburg to Culpeper was 30miles. And the distance From Culpeper to Baltimore, MD was 113miles. And the distance from Baltimore, MD to Fredericksburg, VA was 103miles. Total of 246miles. I drove total distance of 246miles for 6hrs 19min 52seconds. Please see the attachment. After I dropped off the passenger,E, I only received $86.38. I should have received at least $250 for the total miles I driven and for the waiting time at the gas station in Culpeper, VA and at the house in Warrenton,VA. I waited at least more than 20min at each stop.\"  This is what I received from Lyft March 8th 2019:  \"Thank you for being in contact with Lyft support, In regards to Es ride. Im happy to assist you today.  I understand how important are your earnings for you thats why I was checking this ride step by step and  I can see that your earnings were correct based on the time and distance rates for this ride’s region. Let me clarify some points in this kind of situations, each driver is allowed to complete a ride with no more than 100 miles, when a ride has more than 100 miles the app does not recalculate the ride correctly because it got the maximum of miles. In the future, I suggest you take care of it.  I attached you the information about how was recalculated the ride. I hope this information can help you a lot.  Earnings$86.38 Time Cost ($0.2250/minute x 379.85 minutes)$85.47 Base Charge$0.91 Total Fare$86.38   You can view the rate card and breakdown of this ride in the Driver History tab of your Driver Dashboard.  If you have anything else that I can help you with, Just let me know, I will be happy to assist you.  Regards,  Lyft.\"  So, they are NOT compensating. They blame on drivers. If app does not recalculate directly, then it is Lyfts fault. How can they blame on drivers? and i did not even know about no more than 100 miles BS. This is so wrong. Plus Lyft admits that \" your earnings were correct based on the time and distance rates for this ride’s region.\"-Yes, I drove 246miles and you fucking know it. I should gotten paid at least $250.

However, no one has sent me any messages or email. I have sent them multiple emails and they have not replied back yet. It is more than a week. To be exact--9 days since i submitted a report. I do not know who the managers or supervisors are, but they need to take a review as soon as possible and send me compensation. This is sooooo frustrating. Does anyone know the telephone number to call? cause im exhausted.  Update: 3/13/19 8:13AM. https://i.imgur.com/qVBHuVn.png  I received an email from Lyft and received compensation of $213.62 for miles. It took exactly 9 days to get it back after sending numerous emails, sending multiple messages to @AskLyft via Tweeter, talking to Lyft employees at Lyft hub, calling Lyft,etc. I want to say thank you to those who supported me and helped me with providing valuable informations.

Email I sent to LyftLink to screenshot of what it looks like [Lyft personal power zone](https://imgur.com/a/zlgopRD)  Is there any way you can revert me back to the old Prime time surge pricing? Personal power zone is a scam and barely pays anything. It’s almost as if the intent was to eliminate surges altogether or at the least reduce the amount significantly. I have a really hard time believe real, experienced (18 months+), high earning, full time drivers are actually earning more with PPZ in a non-heavily controlled environment.   Among the problems I have with it is, it artificially offers lower surge amounts than Prime Time. With Prime time I know where demand is (that was never an issue, so I’m confused why the app is praising itself for fixing something that wasn’t broken), I knew what the multiplier could be 100-500%, and I had more control in being able to decline trash requests with 25% surge in favor of requests with say 200% or more.   With Personal Power Zone, despite the app knowing what the maximum it is willing to offer you is, it doesn’t disclose that to the driver. That’s like saying go to this area because I’ll pay you more but I won’t tell you how much more, just trust me..... The app makes you wait for the power zone bonus to increase by 1-4 cents which is quite honestly a bit insulting. Why make us wait? Why not give us the max upfront? Then it locks us in the location as in we can’t leave the location or else we lose that specific bonus amount unlike with Uber. Although the app can send us requests of riders outside the zone without a bonus while we’re in it which makes absolutely no sense and defeats the entire purpose. I think it’s wrong to not apply the bonus to each individual pool passenger. Uber does.   Since the change, my earnings have been in freefall. I generally shoot for $200-250 a day after Lyft commission fees, now I’m lucky to hit $150, and that’s because the surge is being artificially tampered with, I suspect. Comparing screenshots from this and last year, there is a huge surge difference. This Year has way less surge while last year there would be a 300-500% almost every morning. Especially when it rained or snowed unlike earlier this week when the were no surges for the majority of the day.    If you guys are going to try to copy Uber’s feature at least try to improve upon it, instead of going backwards. What you should have done was copy Uber’s pass through rates, meaning if I driver through a surge region, I retain the rate not matter if I stay in the location or not, as long as I’m online. You should also not set the surge to a fixed dollar amount, instead opting for a percentage/multiplier. Fixed dollar surges are ONLY good for short rides, the longer and out of the way the ride is, the more the driver loses in terms of opportunity cost. Percentage/multiplier surges are good when the ride is long distance but the surge, short distance rides are only attractive if the surge is high enough, say 500%.       ',\n",

Thing is Sanfrancisco is changing zones, streets, signs and rules faster than anyone can keep up.  Itd be nice of Lyft could send something out to passengers requesting that they be in a safe and authorized place for pick-up. These tickets are ridiculous to say the least. Made up my mind that the best thing for me is to stop somewhere safe and call them to walk to where I am or just cancel the ride altogether. You wont even see the persons ticketing you.

I had a trip that was $26 still reflect $26 on my app—even though I was emailed a receipt for $38 and had a $26 and $12 charges on my account.   ——————  I took a trip from the airport to my parents house the other night. It was an uberx... no help placing the luggage into the trunk or out of but whatever... the previous Uber driver that drove me to the airport didn’t but was awesome so much so that I cash tipped him $10 on a $23 ride.  It was my last ten so I planned to tip in the app but good thing I didn’t.  He reported that my trip ended a good 7-8 miles away and so my trip went from $26 to $38.  Needless to say Uber support credit me “.58” when I brought up the issue and I’m fighting for the additional $12 off.  Almost ten years of using Uber and I’ve never come across a shady driver like this.

       " 'It took me 2.5 hours to get somewhere 20 minutes away, and the driver bitched to both me and another passenger by insisting we \"need to learn to use the app\"Sorry for the length. TL;DR at bottom.    I had to get somewhere that was a 20-minute highway drive away. I go there a lot and always take Uber Pool, and also try to leave -1hr early in case other people get added to the trip. So 1hr before my appointment today, I requested a ride and was paired with Driver 1. But Driver 1 never drove towards me, and just sat in a gas station parking lot down the street for 27 minutes. I cancelled. Then I had to re-request, but by that time rush hour had hit and the price tripled. Now, because of that, I had to stick with Pool because the UberX price had become preposterous. Great.  Then I got paired with Driver 2 (a different person), and that person was also sitting in the SAME gas station parking lot for an extended period of time without driving towards me. Then Driver 2 cancelled. Then I got paired with Driver 3, who was over 20 minutes away from my location and already driving in the opposite direction on the highway. So Driver 3 understandably cancelled. Then I got paired with Driver 4 who picked me up.   But Driver 4 was an asshole.   I live in a city that can sometimes be confusing. So I had walked to a nearby building that wasnt busy and easier for a driver to both find and park in front of. But my driver still passed it 3 times. Okay I understand that mistakes happen. However. Where I was located is easy to find, I was the only one standing there, I had talked to her on the phone and described exactly where I was standing and what I was wearing, and I waved as she passed every time. She made eye contact with me every time. The third time I even stood in the street off to the side, so I could step forward a little bit as she approached, but she saw me and then pulled around me and drove past.   On the 4th time around, Driver 4 picked me up, but before I even said hello or had my seatbelt buckled, she was complaining about my pick up spot and blaming me because one of the roads she had to drive down on the way there was missing a street sign (like thats my fucking fault). She wasnt yelling, but she was being curt and talking down to me. I didnt respond to her. I just sat there silently.   Then we went to pick up the next PAX, and that PAX did the same thing I did. She lives somewhere that is hard to pull into, so she walked to a nearby restaurant and requested there in an effort to make a drivers job easier. We pulled into the restaurant parking lot, and you could see the PAX clearly standing there (looking down at her phone then up directly at the car, the only person outside, waving the car over, has a face that matches the profile picture). But Driver 4 still proceeded to drive in circles around this small parking lot, passing her over 6 times. Im not sure what was going on in her head, because that person was clearly who she was supposed to pick up. Driver 4 was also staring at her phone without looking up at the road at all, and driving past exactly where the app was telling her to stop.  Did her brain just flatline for a few minutes? Does she not have enough experience? Was she overwhelmed by driving in the city? Was something wrong that made her act so weird? I dont know. It was strange.    On the 7th time around, she picked up the other PAX. Then, just like she did to me, nastily complained about the pickup location being difficult (it wasnt). This PAX calmly defended herself, saying that she had actually walked to a place that was easier for an Uber driver to find and she was trying to wave her over the whole time. But the driver just cut her off dismissively, made an irritated noise, then ignored the PAX entirely.   We were all riding in awkward silence for a while, then out of nowhere Driver 4 loudly exclaimed that \"people like you all need to learn to use the app before you use it.\" Neither of us bothered responding.   When all was said and done and I arrived at my location, 2.5 hours had passed since I tried to request my first ride. It was far more expensive than I anticipated. Also keep in mind that I had walked to another building to request, so I was just standing in front of a random hotel for most of that time. Its cold outside.   I checked Driver 4s rating, and it was 4.59. I wonder why.   TL;DR Got a series of drivers who werent driving towards me or canceled, then was eventually paired with a driver who was acting weird and bitched at me and another PAX.   Edit: Typo in rating number. Adding a missing \"and\" to a sentence.  ',\n",

The app said my driver was on his way at around 7:10, he arrived at 7:19, and now Im at my destination four solid minutes before my scheduled pick up time was even set to occur. This would be fine, if it wasnt currently cold and rainy.  Whats up with this? Do I need to schedule rides late on purpose to show up on time, or am I set to be at least 30 minutes early for everything?',\n",

       " 'I took an Uber taxi and got over charged by $11. I tried to get an explanation and all I got was the runaround. Goodbye, Uber.Sorry, this is a little long.  Theres a tl:dr at the bottom.  I live in Chicago on the Northside.  I work just North of downtown in an area called Streeterville.  I generally leave for work at around 6am.  The last Tuesday morning, it was really cold and I didnt feel like waiting for the EL, so I checked the ride sharing apps.  The surge prices were about double ($24) what the prices are on a good day and the closest car was 9 minutes away.  I knew that Uber taxi was just the meter and a small surcharge.  I was pretty sure that it would be less than rideshare charge, and it would probably be closer, so I went with that option and there was one only 2 minutes away.    When I got out of the taxi, I checked the meter, which read an even $17.  Thinking that I made the correct decision, I walked into my office.  Thats when I got the notification of the receipt on my phone.  I quickly checked it and saw that a charge of $30 hit my card.  \"That doesnt seem right,\" I thought to myself and checked the app, which showed the charge of $30 broken down to $28 for the fare and $2 for the \"delivery fee\".  Like I said, I knew there was going to be a surcharge, but the additional $11 dollars on the fare did not make any sense.  I sent a request to them to look at my trip and tell me why the fare was $11 more than the meter.  This was the response:   Hi PHWOFL,    Sorry to hear about the trouble.     Weve reviewed your trip. Because your final destination was in the suburbs, your fare reflects the City of Chicagos regulations. These state that trips to the suburbs must be billed for the straight metered rate to the city limits and then 1.5x the metered rate from the city limits to the suburb destination.     Metered fare rates are set by the City of Chicagos Department of Business Affairs &amp; Consumer Protection. Uber has no control over that pricing. Unfortunately, we are not able to adjust these fares.    For more info, please visit our FAQ here. The City of Chicagos site is here. Please let us know if you have questions.  Sent by Susan on Tuesday, March 5, 2019 at 8:48:29 PM  I was absolutely floored by this, as I had not gone to the suburbs.  I mean, they had access to the map of my trip, which clearly showed where I was picked up and dropped off.  So I responded:   Hi Susan,    I do not believe you reviewed my trip, or you would have seen that my final destination was &lt;my office building, which is less than a mile from the center of downtown Chicago.  This is not the suburbs.    My starting destination was also not in the suburbs.  At no point of my trip was I anywhere near the suburbs.    Please review my trip again.    Best,  PHWOFL  They emailed me back about about an hour later telling me they had brought in another team to also look at this.  I waited until Friday morning before contacting them again, asking for a status update and this is how they responded:   Hi PHWOFL,    Im sorry to hear about the trouble. Let me explain this to you.    We are glad to see that our colleague has already provided an appropriate response. We understand your experience has been frustrating, but we will be unable to provide credits or refunds for this concern.  Please know that we review our standards on a regular basis and feedback like yours is invaluable as we continue to design more helpful support experiences for our riders.  Your patience during this matter is appreciated.  Sent by AkshayJ on Friday, March 8, 2019 at 3:10:07 PM  I had a couple of problems with this email, as I felt the line \"Let me explain this to you,\" was needlessly condescending, and he \"explained\" that his colleague had already given an appropriate response.  Since I was still trying to figure why they thought I went out to the suburbs, I didnt feel that I had received an appropriate response and let them know that:   Hi Akshay,    I still do not think I was provided with an appropriate response, as I was told the reason my charge was greater than what the meter read was because I went out to the suburbs, which I did not.  The only appropriate response would be an actual explanation as to why my charge was $11 greater than the taxi meter.    Please know that I will not be using your service in the future and will be encouraging my friends and family to never use your service again, all because you decided to steal $11 from me.    Best,  PHWOFL  I was a little aggravated at this point.  The \"you decided to steal $11 from me\" was a bit much, but I feel that if they really bothered to look at this issue, they would see that it is pretty clear that I was overcharged for the trip.  Anyway, they emailed me right after saying they were still looking into this issue.  This morning, I requested a status update from them and, once again, received the \"We are still looking into this.\"  Having been tired of being jerked around, I responded:  Hello Payal,    It has now been a full day since Ive heard from you and over five days since this issue happened.  This is ridiculous that no one can tell me why I was charged $11 more than what the taxi meter read.  The only response I have received is that I was taken to the suburbs, which I wasnt.  This is even more ridiculous because you have access to the map for my trip and can clearly see that I was not taken to the suburbs.  Furthermore, after not hearing back from you for another two days while \"another team was brought in to look at the issue\", I had to follow up for a status and was then told I had received an appropriate response.    Honestly, it should not take several teams of people over the course of several days to able to look at a map of Chicago and tell that I didnt go anywhere near the suburbs and was charged incorrectly.  I really want to know, is this due to indifference or incompetence?  Those are the only two reasons I can think of.  A few minutes later, I received this response:  Hi PHWOFL,      Were still looking into this issue. Well be sure to check back in with you once weve got a solution.    Thank you again for your understanding and patience.    Let me know if you have any other questions!  Sent by DW on Saturday, March 9, 2019 at 5:40:27 PM  I was just done with putting in any more time and effort into this and responded:  Hi DW,    I cant believe you are serious.  At this point, I honesty doubt that you have the capacity to come up with a solution.  Dont even bother trying.    Im deleting your app and encouraging all of my friends and family to delete it as well.      Remember, this is all because you decided to steal $11 from me.  I did not expect to receive a response, but as I was writing this, they emailed me again, thanking me for my \"understanding and  patience\" and that they still need some time to fix this issue.  My understanding and patience has run out and Ive already deleted their app (as much as you can do on an android device) and my account.  Ill just use Lyft or Via.  I havent had any problems with them.    TL:DR - Uber taxi overcharges me because they said I went to the suburbs instead of downtown.  Tried for 5 days to get some kind of answer.

       " 'Frequent, tipping rider who is allergic to air freshener fragrances, seeking a \"FRAGRANCE-FREE ONLY\" checkbox in user profile.My SO has an autoimmune disease which makes her react badly to airborne chemicals. Every time we take an Uber, she immediately gets a headache and ends up with flu like symptoms for the rest of the day--body aches, nausea. She uses Uber quite often, for long (30 minutes, with tips) rides to and from work, and she basically rolls the dice on whether or not her ride will make her sick. She also gets rashes from it.  Now these little air freshener fragrances are widely regarded to be [toxic] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_freshener#Toxicity) but a lot of drivers do not seem to care. One friend suggested she should consider a lawsuit against Uber for exposing her to health hazards, but she is not the lawsuit type--more the kind who will just suffer in silence, which is why I am posting on her behalf.   Having read some driver opinions about this issue, the reality for drivers is that many riders are gross and leave behind gross smells that impact the way drivers are rated and treated by later customers. I get that. The problem is, I have also had conversations with drivers of fragrance-free cars, and they claim that avoiding cloth seating, airing out the car between fares, and doing some cursory seat cleaning once in a while is all their is to remaining odor-free.   I know this forum is frequented by some drivers who dont appreciate any kind of criticism of their preferred methods--but OTOH, if youre the kind of driver who goes the extra mile to make sure your car smells like nothing, without using fragrances--instead of just covering it up with carcinogens--we greatly appreciate your service, and we always tip you handsomely.  For those who swear by the air fresheners--if nothing else is wrong with the ride we will still 5 star and tip, but **I just wish there was a way we could disclose in user profiles that we are FRAGRANCE FREE riders (which is common in groceries and other products) so that you dont have even see us as fares at all, and so you wouldnt get dinged by Uber for passing on a fare.**  Thanks',\n",

It seems either the function doesnt work properly or absolutely no one is headed my way.  Is there a solution to avoid wasting so much gas? These long rides pay well but I also lose money having to drive long distances empty.  Also, I dont feel comfortable declining rides for non-safety related reasons because my low total number of rides (21) means that turning down even one pax will tank my acceptance rate.

       " 'Is it just me or are earnings higher in the suburbs?Just a few things that I noticed the last couple weeks since I began driving in my free time. The suburbs seem to be the most profitable, at least in my area likely because of a few major malls and some casinos in the area.    Heres an example, I was driving around the city and I had a passenger go from one side of the city to the other. The trip took roughly 55 minutes and I netted about 25$. In the suburbs that same night, I had a ride that lasted 16 minutes and I needed roughly $13 which is over half the rate I got from the longer trip.    This is just one example over the last couple weeks and I am beginning to notice a trend.  Most of my rides in the city seem to be about 4-6$. Sure rides are higher in demand in the city, but I am averaging a higher hourly rate with a lessor demand which means less driving and a higher savings in gas.    Another thing in the burbs is that the rides tend to be longer and more direct. I am not waiting in traffic and burning unneeded gas.    This week I have been averaging about 28$/hr in the burbs.

       " 'Why I cancel any calls I get in Niles MichiganYouve all seen it. Youre driving and you get a ping. Trying to keep your eyes on the road, you dont process the little bit of information that Lyft sends you. I got a call earlier this month. I was in South Bend, Indiana and got a call to an street address I didnt recognize. I accepted it and drove through the bad roads to get it.  It turned out to be 19 minutes away. In all, I wasted close to an hour on this call driving there and back. And heres how the charges were split up.  [Niles Michigan fare that cost me nearly an hour.](https://i.redd.it/rcyzhd4gggj21.jpg)  I finish it up and head back to Indiana. Chalk it up as never do Niles again. Get another ping, Niles again, decide as long as Im there, Ill grab it. Half way there, ride cancels, no cancel fee. (one reason why it took nearly an hour to get back to home turf) I get another ping to go to the SB airport. He cancels because Im too far away. Another ping for Niles, but I ignore that one. Finally, as I cross back into Indiana, I get a ping 5 minutes away in South bend. Pick him up, take him to work over by the airport.  No problem. But every time Im in South Bend, I get pings to go to Niles. I dont mind an 18 minute haul in the South Bend/Elkhart area. Usually decent fares for the trip. Niles? Its a small city where the rides dont last long. A drive of about 15 miles from where I was to pick up a passenger going 1.26 miles. Took nearly 4 times as long to pick up the pax than the ride itself. Ive been suckered into two of these calls, both times the calls werent worth the time and effort. And the bastards didnt even tip, even knowing I came a long way.  Since Lyft refuses to let us know upfront what city the calls are in, Ill accept them on the fly, but the moment I find out that its Niles Michigan, I cancel the ride immediately.  I dont even bother calling. Pax get pissed at Lyft: big deal. They can call Uber and pay the long pick up fee Uber charges. (Lyft doesnt have that fee, which is why pax call us) Gas prices have been on the rise again, and even with 30+ MPG, its a major waste of gas and time for these pax.   So, if youre in Niles Michigan and get your call canceled on you, you can just look at why Lyft charges so little. ',\n",

As I sat in the back, he opened the door and told me to go in front \"I broke my phone stand on the way,\" he said \"so Im going to use your phone for GPS. Understood?\"    I said \"sure\", asking myself why this man was talking to me like I was his child.    On the way, he kept asking me if there was a Wal-Mart in the neighborhood, I told him there wasnt any around. I thought he wanted to buy himself a new stand after dropping me off. Boy was I wrong. He wanted a new one NOW. When the driver saw what is basically a Home Depot on the side of the road he decided to go in the parking.    He stopped his car  in the middle of the way and asked me if it was okay if he went inside to get himself a new stand. I said no, that we didnt have much time -I left early, but not too early- and that I didnt mind using my phone as a GPS.    \"But what am I gonna do with the other clients?\" he asked, before running into the store.    So I sat there for several minutes, asking myself if I should cancel the ride, how long it would take to get a new one, how late I already was. When I had enough and was ready to get a new driver, the guy ran out of the store empty ended. They dont sell stands, he told me.    So he finally drove me to the train station. We had to go in circles a few times because we couldnt find the entrance. The driver had the guts to blame me for this, saying Im not telling him where to go. He doesnt realize I really have no interest staying in his car, if I knew the way I would have told him.    Finally, I got out of his car at 4:49. My train was at 4:50. As I entered the station, I saw that it was pretty much empty, there were employees, but no passengers. I approached gate 15 where I was supposed to take my train and saw that the stairs were blocked. A few seconds later, I felt the ground shaking under me. The train is gone. These minutes I spent waiting for him to get a new phone stand, and the ones we spent going in circles could have changed everything.  According to Uber, this isnt ground for a full refund. They gave me a few bucks back and a credit for my next ride when I pressed support about how bad the situation was.',\n",

       " 'I got accused of being high/drunk while driving Lyft last night, and it was bs.So I’ve been driving for Lyft for 6 months. It’s my full time job. I live in New Orleans, a big tourist city, so money is always good here. I’m a Platinum driver with a 5.0 star rating(4.9 now because of this). I’ve completed over 1,600 rides since I’ve started. I love driving for Lyft. I love driving. I’d like to think I’m always nice to my customers and provide them with a comfortable and safe ride. Well one person decided that for some reason that they either didn’t like me or that they wanted to not pay for the ride, hours after being dropped off.  So this person, whom I do not know, reported the ride I gave them saying that I was under the influence of drugs or intoxicated. They did this at 3:30am. I got the email reporting that my driver account was deactivated around this time. I got a follow up email from Ms. Georgia in the Trust and Safety Department at 5:30am asking when is a good time to call to address the issue. I was asleep for all of this. I wake up at 10am, go out to drive at 11am. Find out I can’t drive because of everything listed above. I write a response saying I’m available whenever and give them my number. Half an hour later Ms. Georgia calls me and just wants for me to explain my side of things.  Here’s the truth. I am not on drugs, I do not partake in any illegal drugs. I have prescriptions for non-narcotics that do not effect my alertness or reflexes. I do not drink (funny because I live in the city where everyone gets drunk on a nightly basis). In fact the last time I drank alcohol was last year around this time for my sister’s wedding. Ms. Georgia told me she understood at that the email complaint was very vague as to how I was acting, and that after 1,600+ rides, this was my first report filed against me. She apologized for the inconvenience and reactivated my driver account.   It is now end of day for me. I drove for 8 hours, made $150, and made it home before 9pm to spend time with my family before we go to bed. Thank you Ms. Georgia for recognizing a bs complaint and helping me to take care of my family. And to the rider who thought that I was a pushover they could take advantage of, I hope you get nothing less that 300% surge charges for the rest of the time you’re in town.

Lyft wont refund us for the incorrect route because when we realized we were in the wrong area we decided to go home instead of to our original destination, costing us ~$50 extra.  A couple of weeks ago my spouse and I were planning to take a ride to a store a few miles away from our apartment, go shopping, and then take another ride home. The Lyft driver we had entered the wrong address in Google Maps (ignoring the Lyft app directions) and took us in completely the wrong direction. We were about 14 miles in the wrong direction when we noticed we werent headed the right way.  At that point we realized the store we wanted to go to would be closed by the time we got there, so we just changed the destination to our home address instead. Big mistake, apparently since the address was changed it means they absolutely will not refund any part of the ride. Even though the Lyft drivers mistake turned what should have been a 10 mile trip into a 30 mile trip that cost us nearly $70 (quoted price around $20).  I understand there are probably plenty of people who write to Lyft customer support for stupid reasons and need it explained to them that you cant just add a destination and expect the price to stay the same, but thats not happened with us. I would be more than happy to pay what it would have cost to drive us  the correct route, but because we cant get it adjusted were paying easily 3x the quoted price for the drivers mistake.   Weve been back and forth with Lyft several times and they just keep giving us the same canned response: I understand you were quoted a different price, but since the destination changed the price changed. If Id known this was going to happen I would have just let the driver take us to the closed store and called a different driver to take us home. I also dont understand why they cant look at their records to see that the driver took us in completely the wrong direction *before* we changed our destination.

I am deducting the standard mileage for IRS and my tax software has asked me to report property tax I paid and interest I paid on the loan.  I broke down the figures and uber is ~30% of my car use. Lyft is ~18%.  I am separating the Schedule C form (1 for uber. 1 for lyft). Do I need to calculate 18% of my vehicle taxes/interest or just report the whole total I paid? Obviously I am not going to claim it twice. I will claim it for my Uber \"business\" and leave it off of the Lyft \"business\".  I didnt earn enough to warrant a 1099.

       " 'Can anyone tell me why lyft has sucked these past few monthsI started using Uber about 3 years ago back in 2016. It was super convenient for me because at the time I was living up at college with no car. Easily took over a hundred rides throughout the course of 2 years. Never had any issues with Uber. Then I started hearing all these things about Lyft so I thought I’d download the app and cross compare between Uber to see which prices were cheaper depending on where I was going. 9/10 times it was Lyft that ended up being cheaper. Never had a problem with Lyft until around a few months ago. Ordered a Lyft (a relatively short ride, about 10 mins total). When it got to be a few blocks away the countdown started ticking that we had to be in the car. It was still a decent distance away, even if we could walk the distance it would be impossible to make it in that time. Called the driver multiple times, didn’t answer. Eventually hit with the no show fee. Great. This similar situation has happened multiple times. Then last week I had the pleasure of having someone else “steal my ride”. Long story short, ordered an Lyft. Said the guy was 4 minutes away. When he was 2 minutes away the clock started clicking that we’re departing soon. Called him, no answer. He then starts going away from our location. I thought maybe he was turning around and the GPS kept rerouting him. After rerouting 4 times I figured he wasn’t showing up. Called him again, no answer. Then all the sudden it changes to the screen to tip/rate my driver as if I’m taking a ride. He ended up picking someone else up like a mile away from where he was supposed to pick me up. I contacted Lyft right away (customer service sucks it’s all through email with is frustrating, but they are fast I’ll give them that). Ended up refunding me the money. But still. I don’t understand why I keep having these issues with Lyft. I deleted the app and will only stick with Uber because I feel that even if I have to pay extra for Uber, the service is worth it. I’m starting to think Lyft drivers are seriously underpaid because of the amount of shitty drivers I’ve encountered. It would make sense because like I said before, 9/10 times Lyft fares are cheaper. I need a drivers perspective here. I’m genuinely curious as to why Lyft drivers have been doing this lately. Is there a reason behind this? Because my friends have been running into similar problems with them too. ',\n",

    "-Uber posts have a mean of 42.98 words while Lyft posts average 43.82 words. <br>\n",
    "-The overall word count distribution is quite similar between the two classes - very positively skewed with the majority of posts containing 0-70 words (some have 0 words but have an image, video, or link attached). <br>\n",
    "-If we zoom in a little, there is a slightly higher occurence of Uber posts between 0-9 words and Lyft posts between 10-53 words.<br>\n",
    "-There are 12 words that appeared in the top 20 highest occuring words for both subreddits. <br>\n",
    "-Of the top 20 words, most are more or less evenly distributed amongst the two classes (sometimes higher in one subreddit than another), however there are bigger gaps between the word 'ride' (426 times in the Lyft posts vs. 265 times in the Uber posts), and most drastically with the word 'uber'(1217 times in the Uber posts vs. 150 times in the Lyft posts).<br>\n",
    "-For each subredddit, the most common word is that respective word itself, with 'lyft' appearing 991 times in the Lyft posts and 'uber' appearing 1217 times in the Uber posts. <br>\n",
    "-Interesting: The word 'uber' is the 15th most common word of the Lyft posts, however 'lyft' is the 45th most common word in the Uber posts."
