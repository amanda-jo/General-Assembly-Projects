1,"Uber should add this feature to their app to make it more safe...A woman was killed after mistaking someone else as her uber driver.  One way to prevent this is to add a feature to the app to let the uber passengers know that their uber driver has arrived.  Basically, before any uber user goes inside the car, they should get a message in their app saying that their driver has arrived AND that the drivers can see their passengers outside the car.  Had this feature been on the app, the woman would not have gone inside the wrong car."

0,"Uber or Lyft while vacationingSo, I would like to start doing Uber or Lyft in my car, specifically so I could road trip and still be able to make money.   However, I have heard something about how you have to be registered a drive in a certain area only. I have also heard that some states, like NJ, you cant drive for other states like NY. But NY drivers can drive in NJ.  Anybody have experience being an Uber or Lyft driver all over the US?"
0,"I got co-erced into getting someone a Lyft, what are my options?To make a long story short, I was co-erced and sexually harassed/threatened by a drunk stranger at a bar. I was cornered and the bar security eventually got to him but by the time they did the Lyft had arrived. This stranger ended up burning a small hole in the drivers seat with a cigarette as he got into the car, so now I am being charged damages. I have tried to contact Lyft about this but havent gotten a response.    For context, I am a 52"" female who was just trying to enjoy the Super Bowl at a local dive bar that Im a regular at. This guy had me physically cornered and watched everything I did on my phone so I felt like calling the police wasnt an option but I did try to ask the Lyft driver through messages to call police and explain the situation to which he basically said ""tough shit, I cant do anything"".    Do I have any options here or am I going to be eating this $150 fee regardless of the situation? Are there any legal options I can take against this person? I am not looking for sympathy, only answers."
1,"Is Uber accepting salvage cars these days?There is a place near me called East Side Auto that sells hail damaged salvage cars of new years, but mechanically everything runs well.

1,"I was able to get voice control working on my android One Plus Phone and was able to talk and say tap 7 for the Uber Go Button. I did this because of a ticket I got that cost me $225 for touching my phones screen to accept Airport ping.That ticket taught me a lesson, the law doesnt care if youre driving Uber.  Because of the texting deaths in Minnesota, they are strict about anyone touching a phone screen, so now am happy I can voice control this thing.   **Here is the harsh ticket I got, for extra money they allowed it to stay off my driving record which is good because I dont want insurance to go up on me** https://imgur.com/a/oNntLev  **Here are the screenshots of me operating the Uber with just Voice Control** https://imgur.com/a/V6fiSGA     With the voice control all objects and apps are assigned numbers, and those numbers never change, for Uber it is 8.  All I have to say is 8 to open the Uber app, and then say number 7 to hit the Go button.  The decline button will have its own number too.  This is a Google made app called Voice Access which is available free on app store.   For you iPhone guys, there may be another app that can do this too or maybe Siri can do it.    The hearing officer for my ticket said regardless of Uber, the driver must pull over to accept a ping and that cant happen on a freeway where I can cause a hazard if I pull over or in most city streets where there are parked cars and nowhere for me to pull over (especially in downtown), unless in city I pull over to gas station.  But with the voice control thing I got going, I wont need to touch or look at phone screen, I will just interact with it via voice and have it auto navigate.   Just to make back that $225 I had to drive at hours and times I didnt normally work.  So I essentially drove for free thanks to the ticket.  They are really cracking down on texting and driving and this means anyone touching their phone screen even if they are not touching, cops dont care as they will still give you ticket despite you the Uber driver just accepting a ping and not actually texting.  http://www.startribune.com/texting-while-driving-citations-in-minnesota-jump-30-percent/504803162/"

In direct conjunction with this my uber rating has started dropping. Are yall as drivers expecting us to tip to get a five star rating? Nothing has changed about how i take ubers. Still waiting at the curb as they appear, still friendly but keep to myself unless the driver talks to me. Been taking uber regularly for a good 5 years now. Original rating was a 4.88 and after i stopped tipping it started dropping to 4.7."

1,"Anybody else not get their 1099 yet?I should preface this by saying I deleted my partner account with Uber mid-January (I drove for them for several months in 18), but I dont see how deleting my account would affect me getting my 1099 when I selected e-delivery for my form when I signed up.  Its not like they wouldnt still have my information stored.    I realize I can just look up the deposits on my bank account and file that way, and I probably will end up doing it that way, but if I had known Uber was going to not send me one I wouldve started retracing my deposits already.  And I cant find a number or e-mail where I can reach them on the website because my account no longer exists.  What a goofball company."
0,"How do I get reimbursement for EZ-Pass?I picked up a passenger from airport and went through EZ-PASS lane because thats where app guided me to. When I received the a ticket via mail, I paid the fee and then submitted the receipt to Lyft. This is what they said:  I do apologize for not getting back to you sooner. Right now, I am following up on your feedback about this toll.  I appreciate you providing us with this review about this toll, however, after having looked into your account, I was not able to locate any ride given on Mar 8. 2019 around 10 AM.  Please, keep in mind that the tolls incurred during the active rides (between the pickup and drop-off locations) should be paid by the drivers and later Lyft reimburses the paid amount based on the electronic toll collection system price.  This is normally less expensive than the cash price and other payment options (such as cash, by mail, by plate, etc).  Its recommendable to pay tolls with an in-state electronic toll collection system, like FasTrak, TollTag, or EZ-Tag, because it will ensure that youre not paying additional money for tolls and then get reimbursed the correct amount.  These systems give your passengers a smooth, fast experience when going through tolls. Theyre also the safer option, as you wont be required to carry cash.  That being said, the only amount we could be able to reimburse you for these tolls is the one paid with tag/transponder.  Observe that some roadways have optional express or HOV Lanes, which charge a fee for their use. Lyft’s toll policy does not reimburse drivers or charge passengers for using these lanes.  When on a ride with a passenger, you will want to use the lanes where an additional toll is not required.  If a passenger request for you to drive in the Express Lanes, you can kindly let them know the Express Lanes are not included in the Lyft ride.  For more information about Lyfts toll policy, please visit the article on our Help Center at How tolls work for drivers.  Since were unable to reimburse for any penalty toll fees, in the case that you get a ticket, it is highly advisable reaching out to the toll authority directly to see if they can offer any help.  thank you for your understanding and your commitment to the Lyft community. Dont hesitate to email us, if you need further assistance.  See you on the road""  The time theyre talking about is the time they sent me the ticket from EZ-Pass."
1,My Uber account has been deactivated for no reason and they are now asking for my card details to unban it? Is this normal? 
1,"UberEats threaten deactivation(Screenshots in comments). Repost from /UberEats  Okay, so I order a McDonalds through UberEats in the UK as we dont have McDelivery in our area. Its always a hit or miss when ordering from them as they usually forget an item or youll get a driver driving carelessly. Ive had to request a refund a few times which Ill go over below;  1. Have had a driver with a low rating that spilled our drinks (coffee, diet coke) in the bag and cursed on the way up the stairs as he realised what was happening to the bag.. he was holding the bottom of the bag before passing it to us before quickly heading away. The bag burst in my livingroom and ruined the carpets as it was literally a bag of liquids. I had to notify UberEats and sent photos of the damage and they only refunded me the drinks (we ordered about £15 worth of food which got ruined also).  2. I ordered pancakes with double sausage and a sausage mcmuffin and only received pancakes and the muffin was burnt. It cost extra to have pancakes and sausage nevermind extra sausage so I told them about this and took photos. They refunded me 40p for the extra sausage which I tried to explain to them I never received the actual sausage nevermind the extra one.   3. This time was from Subway, I ordered a foot long meatball marinara and they sent a completely different sub which I couldnt eat and they refunded me.  Now, my Grandmother (a different debit card was used) ordered a McDonalds through my app as I was visiting her and she ordered her food and told me she ordered before and stuff didnt come and I told her they can be like that. We ordered £25 worth of food and she didnt get 2 chocolate muffins which I informed UberEats about and they sent me this message, I explained to them its a different card used so Im not ""scamming"" them and they told me I would get my account deactivated. My grandmother is retired and gets money off a pension so it may not seem a lot to lose but its her money. I wouldnt need to request refunds when the case is the restaurant and their drivers being careless.    "
0,"Hit and run, property damage. How to proceed?Hey Lyft!  I used the service for the very first time over the weekend. After we got dropped off Saturday night my fiancé noticed our driver hanging out in front of our house for an extended period of time looking at the rear of his car. She thought nothing of it as we live on a steep hill and thought he may have scraped when leaving. Well today we saw where he actually clipped the end of a brick retaining wall and destroyed the brick masonry on the last 2 feet of the wall. No call, doorbell ring, nothing. We already emailed lyft and are waiting to hear back. Basically, what are we in for?  Any chance we get the repair covered?  Any advice?  Thanks!"
1,"Car and plates didnt matchHi, I requested an uber today, got a call from the driver asking if I could see him and saying that hes right in front of me behind some people. The car was different from the one in the app. I checked the plates and they did not match either. I asked him to open the window and communicated my concern about the car and the plates. He said that he has just bough this car and they havent updated the information. I declined, he asked if I wanted him to cancel and I said ""yes"". Would someone consider it safe to take uber even if the car is different? Why would a driver still take passengers in this situation?"

0,"Any tips for first time rider?Hello everyone!  So today my car broke down and I don’t know when I’ll be able to get it fixed but that’s not the point. I have an order I’m supposed to pick up on the 29th and was thinking of taking Lyft to get there. The store is 7 minutes away from my house if you drive but it would be too far to walk. The charge is $3.42 with the discount for the first 10 rides which brings me to my first question, does this take away from the drivers total and is there any way I can get rid of the discount if it does? I don’t want to hurt someone out of their living.  Second, if I want a round trip do I have to order two separate lyfts? This is my first time using the service so I have no clue how it works.  Third, what should I tip my driver? I imagine it would be better to tip them in cash rather through the app or maybe I’m just old fashioned but what’s a good tip protocol?  I’d love to hear from both drivers and passengers! Thanks in advance.  TL;DR  What are some tips for a first time passenger? Does the first 10 rides discount hurt the driver? Do I have to order two separate lyfts for a round trip? What’s a good tip protocol?"

Pax mentions that happened before so I drove to airport and told pax I would need to leave him at his real destination but continue driving to complete the route. As I drove 7 extra miles I see that the destination point is unreachable as gps was pointing to a dilapidated road behind a fence. I didn’t know what to do so I took some SC and has to cancel the ride as I didn’t saw any other option. I contacted Lyft with the details and they won’t pay me because I canceled the ride. They say to use Drop off next time. I need to find that option. Lyft CS is terrible, I didn’t expect much but is the second time the let me down and now straight robbing me. I hope I can find a real job soon."

I considered stopping mid way through and ending the ride for the sake of me making it home safely but decided to carry on and get the person to their destination cause im a nice guy. The PAX said several times during the trip they would give me a hefty tip. 4 1/2 hours later hes where he needs to be and I start my trip back home which is another 4 hour drive.   Today is the next day, and surprise surprise, no tip. PAX even reminded me one more time as he was leaving my car that he would leave me a good tip. People that act like this just make feel like doing [this](https://i.imgur.com/aYP6MB9.png)  and yeah, I know, it was a long ride and I got good pay for it anyway so why the complaint, Well, the ride is a recent example of me going out of my way to help someone and still getting an empty promise.

Then demanded I cancel. I told him it is his illegal account it was his chore to cancel and fight with Uber. I did not start trip and was 3 minutes short of the timer. Want to go back online. I drove off and cancelled.  2 minutes later same clown  pinged me and followed it up with a request for cancel.

1,"How would someone go about escalating a health and safety matter?approximately a week ago, i noticed multiple adult head lice on the headrest of the seat in my uber, i sent a picture of 2 the lice to uber, and informed the driver, he ensured me hed make sure he immediately delouse his car. i have only his word that he did that, but no reason to doubt him, he seemed just as shocked and alarmed as I.  however a week later i have found baby lice pop up, either one i didnt notice got in my hair, or there were also eggs on the headrest (i didnt notice the lice till half way into a long trip) and some slightly larger ones in my own hair, and uber offers nothing but cookie cutter responses.  with my hair length i need treatment, and new bed linens and other material stuff that has become potentially lousy, and every time i ask for some help with compensation as i do not have the money for it at the time, uber ignores that portion of the question. i have reported it since the moment it happened, then the moment it affected me, but uber in app help either is incapable of understanding or just doesnt understand that its unacceptable to acquire a parasite from using a paid service. and a health and safety risk, as well as plain disgusting.  if someone got hit by an uber and required paid medical treatment they would need to pay, i feel this is a medical condition, brought on by engaging their services and they are responsible for most if not all of the costs of treatment incurred to me, as it is not something i should reasonably expect to be on the lookout for.  i can provide photos, but i would rather not, as lice are disgusting and i dont think any of us want to see that. if requested i will upload the ones i found in the uber however.  theres also the matter that a parasite that was sucking someone elses blood then came into contact with me and interacted with mine, though the chances of anything coming of that are minuscule, its still an additional reason as to just how disgusting this is.  Edit:There seems to be some debate as to me being a troll, i fucking wish i was.

1,"4.76 Uber Rating- why?I cannot wrap my head around how Uber drivers rate their passengers. I just noticed my rating went down to a 4.76... I feel like I’m the ideal passenger. I’m always polite, punctual, and I always tip in cash. I have never made an Uber wait. If the driver doesn’t want to talk, I leave it at that. I had an Uber driver that needed to put air in his tire midway through our ride and I bought him a coffee while I waited. I still gave him 5 stars because I’m not a dick and I understand his job is reliant on his ratings.  It’s just frustrating that I feel I have to work so hard to please a service that I am paying for. The entire rating system is fucked. Can anyone help me understand what I need to being doing differently?"

0,"Lyft passengers are two-faced people. Nice during the ride, but not so nice when giving the ratings. I don’t know what I’m doing wrong here. It’s like for any tiny mistake, I’ll get a 2 or a 3 star rating. Also can passengers also see their ratings from drivers?This is really unfair, I was at a 4.88 rating and now I dropped to 4.82 stars. I don’t remember doing anything bad other than briefly speed a little on freeway to safely merge into a different lane to exit.   I go out of my way to be extra nice, play some good music, turn on the seat warmers, and I also tell my passengers to put their bags and items in my trunk so they can ride comfortably but they insist on a tight space just because they don’t live far. None of the passengers I’ve driven have had any negative vibes with me, if anything I get relaxed and nice passengers. The only ones I’ll complain about are the ones that smell really terrible or will eat in my car without my permission (I state this in my description clearly so I hope for riders to see this!).  I’ll get a 3 star rating occasionally for having a “dirty car” but it’s the winter time and people scuff the back of the front seats leaving streaks of mud and salt on them as well as on my doors. I’m just addressing my concerns because I’m getting two-faced riders and this is unfair. I drive well and intend to safely transport my passengers safely, my Lexus is a very smooth ride and I’m relaxed all the time when I drive but I can’t help but feel people will always be so anal about the little things (I.e dirty floor mats or just a random rating because I don’t talk a lot and I don’t because most of my passengers barely say hi let alone break the ice).   So what gives and how can I improve my rating? People are getting picked up in something super nice for cheap and they’re still ungrateful."
1,"Irritating situation with Express Pool ride this morning: overcharged for getting out early(First, yes, I know I ordered Pool. And, yes, because of that, I know drivers hate me.)  I waited patiently for the driver to arrive after the two-minute countdown -- bizarrely he drove past me and I had to run to the car, but whatever -- and, despite the countdown to get other passengers ""going my way,"" the driver was assigned another rider whose pick-up spot was far north of my destination and his drop-off spot was far south of my destination. Almost immediately, the app noted that my arrival was going to be later than expected, probably because of the extra passengers pick-up/drop-off spots being out of the way.  Anyway, I was only taking a ride to a coffee shop to do some work, so when I saw the first passengers drop-off spot -- about 10 minutes before my estimated drop-off spot -- was near another coffee shop, I got out there -- this means  got out at exactly the same time as the other Pool passenger, and -- to repeat myself -- his drop-off spot was \*ahead\* of my drop-off spot by about 10 minutes.  I rated the driver five stars, saw that it was the $2.35 fare (I have a 50% off for the week), and closed the app. Well, then I opened the app again and saw that I was charged $3.48 for the ride -- far above the estimated $2.35 price with discount.  I contacted Uber via the app and they asked for my pick-up and drop-off spots, which I provided, noting that I got out at the same time as another passenger whose drop-off was ahead of mine.  Well, after the back and forth, Uber gave me $3 Uber Cash, but they still blamed me for not getting out at the final destination -- despite my \*getting out earlier than the original destination at the same time as another Pool passenger\* -- freeing the driver of about 10-15 minutes of  additional driving.  Frankly, I didnt want $3 of Uber Cash. I wanted to get a $1.13 refund for being overcharged. If you get out earlier on a Pool ride, at the same time as another passenger, you obviously shouldnt be charged extra. Uber is a scam a minute. "

0,"My room mates payment was declined, so it charged my card instead?So some backstory to this. I gave my room mate my card info a few months back so he could get home from his boyfriends house. He told me he deleted it, but this morning I checked the payment history on my card and I saw a charge from Lyft. Personally I do not use the app at all, and knowing my room mate uses it to get to or from work depending on whether or not I can pick him up I asked him if he actually deleted my information from the app. He checked his ride history and found the ride in question, which was 2 days ago, and he told me that the payment he chose was declined so it chose a card that was previously used to make the payment instead? Im calling bullshit and just want to see if this is something that Lyft can do, charge cards that have been deleted as a payment method. Any input is appreciated.  TL;DR Room mate is telling me that Lyft charged my card even though it had been deleted from the app."
1,The Funniest Pictures Ever Taken in Ubers and Taxis? 
1,"Driver Rode Off With GroceriesHello,    Ive been taking Uber for the past year and a half or so-- once a week, just to take groceries home from the grocery store. I typically put the groceries in the trunk and carry them all up to my apartment in one trip, so as not to leave the driver waiting.    When I stepped out of the car to get the groceries this time, the driver rode off. I tried knocking on his back window as he accelerated, but he kept going. To make matters worse, Im concerned it mightve been intentional because he kept talking about needing money, looking for extra ways to cover his expenses, etc. Also, I had some of my prescriptions in my groceries!    What can I do? I already submitted a report to Uber via their ""lost items"" options, but it said itll leave a $15.00 fee on my account. Plus, even if the driver comes back, a lot of the stuff (e.g., ice cream) will be melted and useless. Please help me.    Edited for clarity."

1,"Are there girl drivers?So I’m a girl, who does Uber. I’ve been told by MANY passengers that they were very confused when they saw me and thought that they had the wrong car because it’s a girl driving and there’s no other girl drivers in that area. Is it just my area or everywhere??  Also, I do look quite young. I’m 21, but my face is a solid 17. That is another thing they always mention. That they can’t believe I’m old enough to drive for Uber, or that they can’t belive I’m putting myself at so much risk at such a young age.   ALSO. I’ve had other drivers (mostly middle/older aged men) gawk at me and stare. Super weird. "
0,"I spilled a drink in a Lyft on Friday and haven’t been charged a damage feeOn Friday I was being an idiot and accidentally spilled a mango Arizona drink all over the back seat of the drivers car as I was getting in. It formed a puddle on the seat He was rightfully pissed and took pictures. I ran inside the gas station to grab paper towels to clean it up.  He told me he was going to file a damage report and would probably get charged $100 which I’m ok with, it was my fault. It is now Wednesday and I have yet to hear anything from Lyft nor has money been taken out of my account. I have taken multiple rides since then and haven’t been charged a pre-authorization to cover the damage.   Is it normal for damage reports to take a while or am I in the clear at this point?

1,"Uber cancelling after accepting requestThis happened a week ago, and Im a little annoyed about it. The guy called me a few minutes after accepting my ride and asked me the major intersection of my destination. When I told him where I was going, he said ""ok"", hung up, and cancelled. About 3 drivers in total cancelled before I could find someone who took me. Keep in mind this was a snowstorm.  The driver who accepted me, thankfully, was a really nice guy and then told me that they shouldnt cancel on people who need to be somewhere quickly and that they shouldnt be driving if theyre going to ask where Im going.  What do you think of this?  Another situation: about a year ago, I had a minivan accept my request, but then cancel a few minutes later, with a sedan arriving after. Why might this have happened?"
1,"Uber pool questionSo Ive heard from some friends that they can choose if Uber pool picks them up at their location or if they have to walk to a pick-up point, but I dont know where to select that option. Ive been using lyft, because they pick you up at your location and dont have the walk option, mainly if the weather is bad and I dont wanna walk.  When I try to book an Uber ride, my only two options are pool (where I have to walk) or UberX.  How can I get the option for them to pick me up at my location?  I am in NYC so I dont know if I even can toggle between those options tbh "

1,"I wish the Uber app made it more apparent to drivers if there are multiple stopsMy partner and I take Uber to work 5 days a week. We do two stops: drop me off then him about a mile away.   Probably 1 in 10 rides the driver will confirm pickup as we are getting in the car, then think they didnt actually swipe that, and swipes again to confirm first stop. This is before we have pulled away from the pickup spot.   We try to say something about it being two stop as soon as we get in the car to warn the driver since we have ran into this issue so many times. Driver usually just asks for the first address and since it is on the way to the second stop it isnt too hard to deal with. However today when it happened again the driver was really hostile about it and wouldnt cooperate.   Do other people run into this too? How do you handle it? It is frustrating how frequently it happens to us."

0,"No Pax tip = Automatic 3 star ratingAs a rider, I tip like 90+% of the time, so I was very surprised to discover how many Pax dont tip.

I also do this to help warn other driver that the might not want to hustle 10+ minutes out of their way for an ungrateful pax.  Of course, there are some exceptions. Times when I wont 3-star them are:  - Pax is going to or from a minimum wage job where they arent getting tips  - Pax is going to see someone at a hospital, urgent care, etc.  - I actually fucked up, like missing a turn that adds 5 minutes to the trip  - Pax asks for something extra, like a phone charger. If they dont tip in this case, I TWO-star them."
0,"Looks like Lyft has finally become what it was meant to be, a total clone of UberStupid changes in damage reimbursement policies. Really really awful support system. No long pickup fees. Being tight fisted over cancel fees.    By the way, I hope no one out here is actually picking up shared / pool rides. My god. If you are, get with the program.   I noticed there isnt any surge pricing at Midway airport here in Chicago. So Im never going to go to midway for a pickup, at least not when it is at peak activity. Youd think whatever clown shit techno libertarian youve got at the helm at Lyft would have sense enough not to go against the free market and *remove* incentives to meet a markets demand.   (Same thing goes for the McCormick convention center in Chicago. Who the fuck in their right mind would wait 20 minutes in a traffic circle to pick up some out of towner for a short ride to river north for no surge. If Im getting tons of pings that means theres demand, and if theres demand that means my ride is worth more. If you shut that mechanism off Im gonna have zero reason to jump into some messy traffic to fish out some yuppie in a sea of grumpy people.)  So its just Uber now. It wasnt much before that. Saying it was a cut above is a huge stretch. You could probably say it was a slice above. Now its dog shit. "
0,Has any driver gotten a text like this from Lyft? What does it mean? 
0,"Something new drivers need to hear.(This is a repost from me from something I wrote to post here a few months ago, but deleted shortly after it was posted. I decided to repost because I believe that it does need to be said and heard.)  I joined this sub when I started doing Lyft full time 7 months ago. I was so excited and thrilled to be doing it! It was incredible being on my own time and schedule. I really looked forward to going out and driving. After around a few weeks of lurking around this sub, the whole job got a really sour taste in my mouth. I started going out later and coming home earlier. I started to look at nothing but the negative side of the job. I started taking an extra day off in the week. I sat and really started to wonder if I enjoyed it as much as I thought.   I soon had a realization that the community in the sub was the reason for the totally different output I had. I didn’t even realize that reading post after post all day from people cutting the job down and bitching in general, subconsciously totally shifted my feelings. I picked up a job during the holidays and picked back up doing Lyft in full swing a month ago. Since I started, I haven’t been looking at this sub nearly as much as I used to. When you are surrounded by constant negativity, it’s super hard to have any sort of positive outlook at that thing.   I just wanted to leave this post here for anyone who may need to hear it, so here it is:  I make $150 every day I work, which is plenty for my cost of living plus a second income from fiancée. It also equals out to me making in one week what I used to make in two. I work five days a week.  I choose to work late mornings to late afternoons. Even though every market is different, it’s important to realize that people are always needing rides. There’s always this really big myth, and even drivers will say it too, that you can only make real money at night in the city. And even though there is money to be made at night, there’s also plenty of money to be made in the afternoon as well. I personally like being home at night and also not a big fan of the crowd rideshare brings out later in the night.   I have a 5 star rating with hundreds and hundreds of rides completed. Also, almost every single rider leaves me a tip. I usually receive very good tips very often. It is completely not unusually for me to receive tips higher than I made off of the ride percentage. That’s not because Lyft is out to get me like every member of this sub tries to make you believe. It’s because I have a legitimate personality that people enjoy. I always see other drivers and they look miserable. I also always see drivers out cleaning their cars between rides at the airport. I always chuckle at them! The secret to getting a good tip and a good rating isn’t having shiny tires! You have to very quickly, at almost an immediate pace, learn your passenger. Once you learn what type of passenger you have, play off that and you’ll be fine. No one cares about phone chargers, or free water and chips, or an aux cord for the passenger, or all this other BS they try to tell you. In almost 500 rides, I’ve been asked for a phone charger exactly 2 times.   Above all, I enjoy the job. For me, there are way more perks than negatives. I truly believe that the same miserable drivers I see every day with zero personality, are the same type of people posting negative things constantly on here. The job is a blast and you absolutely can make money and get lots of tips. Of course, not every driver has a constant flow of rides coming their way. I will agree that it is very challenging to make real money in a town. But if you live in a city, you have no reason to not be bringing home what you need to bring home every week.   The job isn’t terrible. Don’t let strangers potentially take away your spirit or drive for something you enjoy or look forward to starting. Best of luck of there.

0,Not a Bad First Day! 
0,"Dumb question inboundHey all. Not a driver, but passenger.    Long story short, my car was totaled and Ive been relying on Lyft for rides to and from work. Anyway, when requesting a Lyft, is the price you see on the screen when you confirm the ride you wind up paying?    Two reasons I ask: Friday night on my way home, the driver asked me what the nearest intersection was (???) and I told him. He then asked if that was east or west (like dude, just go where the GPS is telling you). I told him east. What does he do? Gets on the highway going west, and winds up taking the long way round the city.    Today to work, the driver was blatantly ignoring the GPS. Like to the point I was 10 minutes late to work. She started raising red flags when she said, ""I dont know why the GPS is taking me down that road.""    ""The highways that way,"" I told her.    She blew right by the turn. ""See? Now its rerouting.""    ""...… because you blew right by the turn.""    ""Oh, I just dont trust these things.""    So finally we get on the highway (after ignoring another turn and taking the longest possible way to the highway) and get close to work. As were on the exit ramp, the GPS said go straight, she turns right. Like WTF. I can tell you, so far, nothing makes me more uncomfortable as a passenger than that.    So would you guys know? Or are they trying to scam a bigger fare?    Thank you!"

0,"How to be sure a driver is fairly compensatedI’m going to give some context, but there’s a TLDR at the end.   I called a Lyft XL from my hotel to the airport at 4:30am. After getting my excessive amounts of luggage (I’m moving across the country) onto a cart and out of the room, I locked my phone in the hotel room. It was only then that I discovered this hotel didn’t have a 24 hour front desk. I couldn’t get back in my room and my phone, with the ride already called, was locked inside. I knew I had someone who would pick it up and mail it to me, so the biggest concern was the Lyft.  Through the side door of the hotel, we see the car drive by and go to the hotel gates, so we start toward the front of the hotel. No car. Turns out the Lyft couldn’t get in. The gates needed someone at the front desk to let people in without a room key. By the time we figure this out and run the stuff back to the side door by the gate, we just manage to flag down the driver as he’s leaving. He helps with our bags in the rain, drives us the 5 minutes to the airport, and we go on with our day.   When I get my phone back and open Lyft hoping to give the man a solid tip for being so helpful, I find out that he cancelled the ride when he gave up at the gate. I want to send a message to Lyft to correct it and charge me the full amount (and ideally still be able to leave a tip and a good review and any additional praise I could send to Lyft that could possibly benefit him), but I don’t want to risk getting the man in trouble if he wasn’t supposed to be driving me “off the clock.” I’m not sure how applicable that is to Lyft drivers.  Any advice on the best way to proceed?  TLDR: really nice driver took us (and our luggage) in the rain despite having already cancelled our route and I want to get him his money and any kudos possible without getting him in trouble for being “off the clock.”"

So, I have been using the website for Uber Eats instead. About a month back my card expired. I cant update the existing one or delete it, its just expired. If I try add my new one, it points out it is already in the system.    So after about 10 support emails and twitter contact, they came to the conclusion of:    ""Hi, sorry to hear about the inconvenience caused.  Currently,  we dont have an edit/delete option for Uber desktop version. To  edit/delete the payment methods, you would have to do it from the Uber  app.    Hope this helps, have a good day.""    Fun fact, every single email and twitter response I sent from my end pointed out the app was not an option, and it took this damn long for them to work it out and point out that no, that option doesnt exists and that I should use the app.    Suffice to say, I am done, the service was neat until this stupid ass shit occurred. I hope that in the future, when you have a website made, you consider adding the ability to edit and delete user information... you know, like what all fucking developers have done since the end of time."
0,"How to Find Username After Rating Expires?So, Im in an odd situation where I have been going back and forth in e-mails with Lyft, and the Lyft rep needs to know the username of someone from a ride two days ago. As far as I know theres no other way for me to see the username from a previous ride outside of going to the ride in your history, and attempting to give them a rating.      The situation is as follows:    I drove about 16 minutes out to pick up a passenger who had an 8.5 minute ride, and I received a ""ride adjustment"" to compensate the distance I drove to pick them up.     Yesterday, I drove 21 minutes out to pick up a passenger who had a 4.5 minute ride, and I didnt receive any ""ride adjustment"" to compensate the distance at all.     The Lyft Q&amp;A on the app says that they dont offer any perks to people who drive a long distance to pick up someone with a short ride, but Ive received the previous adjustments before, and usually the app would give me a message that says something like ""Thanks for going out of your way to pick up X"" and tell me how much extra I was getting for the long pick-up.     So, is there some way I can still see the username of the passenger from two days ago? Im just trying to show this Lyft rep that the compensation does in fact exist, because they tried giving me the ""we dont offer any long pick-up bonuses at this time"", even though Ive received them before."

1,Uber saying I have unfinished payment?I’m trying to use Uber but it’s saying an account with my credit card has an unfinished payment. I’ve logged into my past accounts and there were no options to pay anything. Is there anyway to determine the specific account they are referring to?
1,"So my Uber Eats account got compromised somehow......and then someone in Russia made 9 trips to a value of ~£250 ($322) over 3 days.  (Ive never used Uber taxis or even had the app installed on my phone btw)  I contacted Uber support and they were very helpful at first. They sent me confirmation that they could see my account had been ""accessed illegitimately"" and that   We have refunded the unauthorized charges. This adjustment will show on your account within the next 10-14 business days.  That was on the 16th of January.  So by yesterday, 6th of Feb, my refund still hadnt come through so I phoned support to see what was going on. Again the agent I spoke to was very helpful and said theyd elevate the ticket once again to the specialised team who deal with these cases.  I then get a reply stating that   it appears that there was an error processing your refund  and  we highly recommend reaching out to your financial institution in order to request a refund (chargeback)"".   Like, WHAT?!  The thing that really irks me though is that in various of their messages they said...  Please note, your card details were not / cannot be obtained from your Uber account.  Which is utter bullshit.   There were two cards linked to my Uber Eats account, my debit card and my mothers (she doesnt have a smart phone and wanted a McDonalds delivery). Of the 9 trips 6 were made on my card, 3 on my mums. So either:  - hackerman got access to both of our cards individually and just happened to use them with the only company where theyre linked in any way (mustve pulled off some Mission Impossible acrobatics shit to do that without either of us noticing), or...  - hackerman gained physical access to my phone for 3 days without me noticing (he didnt, obviously - plus like I say, Ive never used or even had the Uber taxis app installed).  The only reasonable explanation IMO is that they DO hold your card details on file somewhere, linked to your Uber account, and if someone gains access to your Uber account (maybe by spoofing your phone number) they can make purchases on any cards youve linked.  I just got the chargeback through after 3 weeks of stressing about this, and...   #**Fuck Uber.**"

0,"Lyft driver asked to come into my house to use restroom. Has anyone else had this experience?My husband and I took a lyft home from the airport which is about a 50-min ride. When we got close to the house, the driver asked if he could come in to use our restroom. We have a very small house with one bathroom where I keep all of my personal items on the counter.   I felt bad for the driver so we let him in, but in hindsight I think we should have suggested for him to go to the gas station 3 miles down the street. He asked directly so we were put on the spot and didn’t think about that option.   Has anyone experienced this? Are you comfortable letting a stranger in your home in this circumstance? "

0,"Higher Rates for All-Access Subscribers?Were new to this, but....  Ive noticed 2 very different estimates, when I compare fares with my daughters phone. Hers are about $5 higher than mine. The difference is that she is signed up for the ""30 rides for $300"" All-Access Subscription.  Its as if Lyft is charging her more, and therefore, shes not getting the full benefit of the pre-paid subscription.  We took screenshots, but shes at work, so Ill try and post them side-by-side, later today.  Has anyone else come across this?  More info...  When I do an estimate, it shows about $17. Signing her up for the ""30 rides for $300"" subscription seems like a good fit for her. For $300, she gets thirty $15 rides. Anything over $15, is paid at the time of the ride.  [https://blog.lyft.com/posts/subscribe-and-save-with-the-all-access-plan](https://blog.lyft.com/posts/subscribe-and-save-with-the-all-access-plan)    UPDATE:  I contacted Lyft, and have been going back and forth with them.

1,"Missing application for the Uber credit card?So, Im probably a little behind on this one, but after doing some research, I decided to apply for the Uber Visa credit card for the dining and travel perks. I havent actually used Uber in some time (its not available in the small town I currently live in,) so I downloaded the app and logged into my account to get to the application, since its no longer available online. Unfortunately, I cant find it anywhere in the app.  Initially, I thought that maybe the offer wasnt being pushed to me because of my location, but Ive tried everything from having family back in Nashville log into my account to using a GPS spoofer. I contacted Uber support a day or so ago and sent them some screenshots of my portal with the missing credit card offer, and was told that another team would need to be involved and that I would hear back when they came up with a solution.   Has anyone else had this issue and found a solution for it? Is Uber only pushing the card to certain users? I havent stumbled across any other threads about people not being able to find the application link in their Uber app. Im going on a trip soon and Id love to have the card before then, but Im not sure how to go about applying at this point.

1,"Ubers price gouging is a jokeThis morning, I woke up and saw that there were some light snow flurries outside. Typically I walk to work, as I only live 1.3 miles away from my job and so it saves me money to be able to do so.  However, I remembered that Uber had sent me an e-mail earlier this week offering 30% off all rides. Im thinking, ""Sweet, I know there will probably be a price increase but it shouldnt be more than 2 times the normal price.""  So I do my normal routine, pull my Uber app up and type in the address, then do a double take. That cannot possibly say $25. For one friggin mile. And thats *with* the discount. So if I didnt have it the price would have been over $30. I looked outside again to make sure there wasnt a separate monsoon or blizzard going on, but nope. Just some light flurries. If you live in Denver you know what Im talking about.  To those of you saying, ""well u/measure400 you know you didnt *have* to take the Uber""... well, I didnt. I walked. And it was mildly inconvenient. But not 30 fucking dollars of inconvenience.  Anyway I know theres an algorithm and its to ""get more drivers on the road"" but I run into this every time it so much as drizzles at the wrong time of day. And usually I just walk or wait it out. Its just absurd."

1,"Uber Customer Service Falls ShortI had a total of 49 unauthorized Uber trips or UberEats orders using my PayPal Debit Card as the payment method.  The card information was stolen while I was out of town. When I contacted PayPal, Paypal immediately canceled that debit card and issued another debit card.  Uber customer services solution to my complaint was to restrict my ability to use ANY PayPal Debit Card, which did nothing but penalize me for the illicit activity of one Ubers users. Even if they had only restricted use of that particular PayPal Debit Card, there was no need to take that step, as PayPal had already taken care of that.     Uber allowed someone to charge $700 to my debit card without so much as a phone call, text message or email to me. They apparently have no stop-loss measure.  Why wouldnt they have security measures in place to ensure a stop-loss, to prevent any individual who has no association with my account nor any history of authorized use of my debit card before they run up $700 in charges that are completely inconsistent with prior use of the card?    I am concerned that other people may have been victim to similar theft activity and have received the same ""theres nothing we can do about it"" response from Uber.  I do not plan to simply ""let this go."" The individual from whom Uber suggests I ""settle the cost of the \[49\] trip\[s\]\[/transactions\]"" is not able to repay me, as he is bankrupt or otherwise judgment proof. "

1,"JUMP Scooters No Parking Zone Reimbursement. Any recommendations?TL;DR Accudeny placed jump scooter in no parking zone. Any chance for reimbursement from the company?  If there are any people who have experience with the UBER company it must be you guys right? The other day I took my second ride (my first ride was only a min) on a JUMP scooter. I only used it for 9 minutes just to test it out, and then put it back where I found it by a park. Unfortunately, the park was in a No Parking Zone and I was charged quite a bit extra for my ride.   The thing is, I did get a notification on my phone about the No Parking Zone, but what I thought that referred to was a near by path next to the park. In my mind I thought that the park entrance was an ok place to put back the scooter (since thats where I found it and why would anyone leave it there if it was a no parking zone?).   The app asked me to take a picture of the bike parked to make sure it was not in the way of any walk way (which I did). My question is, do you think the UBER company would be forgiving to me and reimburse the fee or no? How could I contact the company as well?  "

1,"Did I get scammed? Do I report it? Not really sure what happened and if it was okay.So Im taking an uber xl from JFK airport to our hotel. We are 6 people each with a piece of luggage, 5 carryon &amp; one check in suitcase.  I request the uber xl, and once a car (black ford expedition) is given to me, I quickly call them to make sure they can fit me. The driver sort of gives me a vague answer, saying that he will tell us when he gets to the airport. So I decide to wait because I am pretty sure a black ford expedition could fit us (which he was driving)  Anyways he gets to the airport, and tells us that we cant call an Uber Xl with these many people + luggage and that we should have called an uber black SUV. So us, not really knowing that much about uber, reluctantly agreed with him and said he would fix it once we got in the car.    We got in and he told me not to change anything through the Uber app, just cancel the Uber XL ride I had requested. So we do and he then quotes us for the price of an uber black SUV (about twice the cost and the cost was according to Ubers prices, so nothing he creates out of thin air). Honestly, we were tired so we agreed. But the thing is, he didnt change anything through the Uber app beyond canceling the initial ride.     We got the the hotel and he charged my credit card through swiping it via one of those phone credit card swipers that you can attach to the aux on a phone. I did end up getting a receipt from it though.  Im pretty sure the charge was not through uber though but through a private business party.    Anyways it seemed like he had good intentions but maybe that me (and us) being gullible. Any advice on if we got dooped and if we should take any action would be appreciated"

The support staff keeps saying to file a police report and that the police can subpoena the drivers info but my police department said they would never subpoena lyft over a lost phone.

0,"Passenger was charged $100 for the soiled and stanky seat they left for me.I picked up an older passenger and I noticed they smelled like bad hygiene.  (They’re  in a wheelchair)  The ride was about 35 min long and throughout the ride the smell became pungent and I had to keep the window cracked. It was a cold night but there was no way I could hotbox with that deadly smell.    I drove as quickly as I could and got passenger  out as fast as possible.  It wasn’t until passenger  left that the smell just exploded into the air and I LOST IT! I made it 3 houses down and i had to open the door and i just started puking in the middle of the street. Still strapped in my seatbelt, leaned out and lifting it go.  This was a God awful smell and i was gagging, tearing, puking. Temperature outside was in the 30’s and probably felt like 20’s.  I had to drive with all 4 windows down to try to air out the car.  I sprayed  in the car but the stench didn’t flinch.  I turned on the light and saw my seat was wet. Not drenched but it had spots where either some sort of adult diaper leaked or This passenger was super moist with funk. Either way their ass juice was penetrating into my cloth seat and I was losing my mind because my vehicle is less than 2 years old 😭. So I take pictures of the seat and send them into lyft and explain my entire experience and they tell me to resend my photos so they can assess the situation and determine what I should be compensated. When I got home I cleaned my seat soooo dang well that the smell is completely gone.  I used a few household products, dog urine odor spray, and bath and body works concentrated room spray.  It took me a while to scrub and soak and then absorb with towels and repeat to finally get the smell out. I left the windows down and let the vehicle air out in the garage overnight. Luckily the smell is gone and no one would’ve even suspected anything happened in there.    Lyft gave me $100 for the damage and said to submit a receipt within 24 hrs or this would hurt my chances of claiming damages in the future.  I let them know in my original complaint/ email that I would try to clean seat and get the smell out but if I couldn’t then I would have to have it professionally cleaned.  Should I just respond with “I cleaned it myself” or go get it cleaned and submit a receipt? I totally wasn’t trying to scam anyone for $100.   P.S I haven’t driven since this incident.  I am one traumatized driver. "

1,"Cleaning Fee ScamLate last night in LA I requested an Uber. A car accepted immediately, and the app immediately showed the ride as already starting.  Within a minute or so, it appeared as if the ride had ended, and it prompted me to rate the driver (I was still on the curb and never saw, let alone got into, a car). We end up taking a Lyft home.   This morning I notice I’ve been charged $5.80 for the ride. No biggie, this thing happens. I can just let them know and they’ll refund me.  Then... I see that the driver has added a $150 cleaning fee.  Again, I didn’t even see this car, let alone get in it.  The driver’s profile has a 2.39 rating and has been active for one day. The driver’s photo appears to be a stock headshot photo.  I’ve opened a ticket with Uber but they’ve given me template answers so far, and as of 9 hours into the dispute, still no hint of a resolution.  Any experience with/awareness of this kind of scam? Is Uber likely to refund me or am I going to have to dispute with my bank?  Edit: corrected driver’s rating  UPDATE: After I opened a second ticket on the suggestion of one of the comments below, Uber refunded the full $155.80, including both the fee and the fare.  Thank you all for your responses and your help!"
1,"Uber driver same picture but different names/carI matched with this driver few months ago, and i clearly remembered his picture. And yesterday, my friend called uber to pick me up and shared me his trip status and i recognized the driver’s face that i had few months ago. But when he picked me up the driver looked different, though i could not see him very well, he was tanner and looked very different from my previous driver. Also his car was different. I told him we matched before but he replied he didnt speak english so i stopped talking  So i asked my friend to send me his receipt and compared with mine from few months ago. those two had exactly same profile picture, but different names and car types. Im not sure if i should be concerned about this and report"

1,"Uber Eats Free Delivery FeatureI occasionally use Uber eats and last week when using the app on Android, there was a free delivery feature. It had four restaurants to choose from (that refreshed after a given time frame) and was free because the order was being paired with another in the drivers vicinity.  I know longer see this option. Was this a limited time promotion? Does it only occur at certain times of the day?  Thanks for any input."

1,"Portland driver abandons wife not even halfway through trip because the ""money wasnt enough for his time""TLDR: Wife had a conference in Portland and needed to get to a 38 min (usually 20 but there was traffic) away location for her parents to pick her up. Driver accepted the drive but threatened her it might not be worth the money or his time but drove off anyway. Not even a quarter of the way, officially decided it wasnt, took the next exit and dropped her off in a high criminal activity industrial area and drove off.  So my wife had a conference in Portland. She drove to her parents house from which they took her downtown. They didnt want to deal with the traffic and being late picking her up so they decide for her to take a Uber to a midway point. Her brother has had a wonderful experience with Uber down in LA, and this being her first ride thought Itll be smooth and easy. But oh no, forget that. Time for a emotional traumatic experience.  A driver sees the request and accepts it. Shows up right infront of her and helps get her luggage into the car.  But right as theyre settled, he threatened her that yes its a 38 min drive (traffic), but the request might not be worth his time and he wont make much money because of the traffic. But whatever, he decides to accept it anyway and drives off.  About 10 minutes into the trip, he officially decides it wasnt worth the effort and informs her that hes going to drop her off at the next exit. She started begging him to complete the request because shes not from the area and just wants to meet up with her parents. But he kept going till he ended up in a industrial area (later research, it has a pretty bad crime problem!!) that she was completely foreign too. Told her he ""called"" another driver, didnt help with her bags, charged the $18, and then said ""oh, so YOU need to hail another Uber"" and just completely abandoned her. She managed to find a hotel and get the address to her parents who drove the whole way to get her after a hour of traffic. To make it worst, her phone died and we live 2 hours away from Portland, and I just got home from work when I got no responce from my text and multiple phone calls. I was worried about her taking Uber by herself in the first place. When she said he called another drive that made me have an anxiety attack thinking something horrible might have happened to her. I was about to grab my gun, drive all the way to Portland and go full ""Taken"" on their ass!  But she was picked up safely by her ""pissed off wanting to sue"" parents and is now home all wrapped in burrito blanket trying to relax.  Is their anything we can do about this driver besides bad review and getting a refund?  Does he have any right to just decide a trip isnt timeworthy and just abandon a passenger?"
1,"Was he allowed to cancel my ride if I just had a dog crate?I had a ride cancelled today because the driver refused to have a dog crate in his car. I disassembled it prior his arrival making sure it’d fit in the back of the trunk, (his car was a Chrysler 200) there was no dog because I just dropped him off at a friend’s place and needed a ride back home. As soon as he saw the crate he told me he doesn’t accept animals and I tried to tell him there wasn’t even a dog present, but he just had a really bad attitude and drove off before I could say anything else. The crate is clean, just kinda worn out over the year and a half, I would’ve understood if my crate was dirty, but that wasn’t the case.   I’m just wondering if the cancellation was allowed? I know he has a right to refuse if there’s an actual animal since mine isn’t a service dog. But I’m not sure about Uber’s policy on dog crates or things similar.  Edit: thank you for the responses, I understand you guys have the right to refuse. Didn’t mean to sound entitled I just wanted to ask.  I’ll leave this post here in case for other pet owners. "

1,Uber to pay $20 million to settle long-running legal battle with drivers 
0,"Follow up post on my theory that Lyft doesn’t actually pay drivers for waiting on passengers...Hear me out, and this is mostly to just stimulate discussion because I’ve heard several solid points defending both arguments. I stand by my theory that Lyft doesn’t pay for wait time, here’s why....  If you wait for a passenger for a full 5 minutes, call them as the system prompts, and are given the go-ahead for the  “passenger no-show” $5 fee applied option, obviously you select that and get paid.   On one occasion, I had a passenger call me and kindly state that they miscalculated their clocking out time at work, their boss was having them finish up a task, and told me to do what I need to do and go ahead and charge the $5. It wasn’t a massive inconvenience for me to have spent that 5 minutes there and the follow up phone call was super genuine so I selected the “Passenger said to cancel” options. It was a busy night and I sympathized with the dude who was being kept late by his boss.   No $5 fee applied.   I feel like this is a pivotal point in the argument.  Same process; 5 minute wait....follow up phone call. No compensation for waiting simply because you selected “passenger said to cancel”.   If Lyft is in fact paying drivers to wait...shouldn’t that mean that I would be compensated for that time? Maybe not the full $5 (although it shouldn’t make a difference) but at least whatever this mysterious “wait time is included in your fair” amount??? "
1,"Hey Drivers, Stop Messaging me that you’ve arrived before you’ve actually arrived!Huge pet peeve of mine when an uber driver pre-sends an “I’ve arrived” message. 9/10 times I’m waiting outside at the pick up location and I’ll receive the message and the driver won’t even be on the block. You do know we already get a notification when you’re 2 minutes away as well as when you arrive right?  Edit: Seems like a lot of you think I have a problem with the messenger itself. Nah, that’s not the case, just the disingenuous and improper use of it."

0,"Why do I have to fight Lyft over a $5 cancellation fee?So a passenger ordered a lyft and they put the pin in the wrong spot. The passenger called me after I had been waiting at the spot for a few minutes asking where I was at. ""Im outside so and so bar."" ""oh, were at waffle house on the otherside of town."" okay, I advise them to cancel the ride. On my way to hanging up, I accidentally hit the pick up button and had to cancel on my end, because clearly I didnt pick them up. I email lyft and explain. They get back to me and say something along the lines of ""we see the passenger was not at location, but since you didnt call them, we cant give you the $5 cancellation fee."" Okay? So I explain it a bit more clearly. I get another email back. ""Yeah, the ride requirements were not met. You dont get the fee. Have a nice day."" Bitch, Im not trying to take a $100k loan with a 500 credit score. Im trying to get paid for the time and money spent picking up a passenger that wasnt there. Lyft taking this $5 seriously. "

1,"Fair Car Rental Uber PromotionI lurk Reddit pretty frequently and couldnt find something that could help so i finally decided to make an account.  I recently rented a car thru Uber’s partner fair which has a promotion that states if you do 70 rides in a week you get $185 bonus and 120 rides gets you $305. Which is great to me as the rental fee is $202 after tax.   Problem is that I didnt see the promotion on my app and stupidly didnt think nothing of it until trying to contact uber after the first week of driving, to get my bonus. First week I did 70+ and second week I did 120+. All it has been is back and forth telling me to contact the rental company and they tell me to contact uber. Uber says they have nothing to do with it when it is clearly stated on their website. +++ Uber support told me that the car didnt seem as it was showing up as a rental which im guessing could be the issue. but the team that handles this doesnt have a phone line and you have to email back and forth. with the emailing they don’t address all my concerns and just send automated responses that dont help and just tell me to call Fair car rental. It has just been a headache.   Im curious if anyone has gone thru this and was able to obtain their promotion they deserve after meeting the requirements or just stuck in the same place like myself?  TLDR: Anyone use Fair Car rental for uber and receive the promotion Uber says to be offering on their website? "
1,"Uber customer service nightmareHello everyone  I had an issue with Uber and their customer service, which was just automated replies to what I was trying to explain and ask. It was a thread of 15 automated messages with each one saying the same thing more or less  I called an Uber and during the chat with the driver, I learned he told me he lived in my condo building. After getting home, I noticed that I left my umbrella in his car. I knew of the lost item fee from Uber about returning the item and I did not want my umbrella back if I had to pay that. I am on a student budget and my umbrella was not worth the $15.  Uber has a standardized message before they connect you with the driver regarding the lost item saying you can be charged $15. This fee would not apply if the item is returned to a police station or to one of Ubers designated hubs.   So before being connected to speak with the driver through the Uber phone relay, you accept a disclaimer that you may be charged for the return of the item, espeically if the driver has to travel somewhere or stop accepting rides. I spoke with the driver and said that I dont want this fee charged and if he can return the item when he gets to the building. He said that of course this would be fine and even named the concierge person by name that we both know. The agreement was that he would return the umbrella after finishing work to drop it off at the desk before he stepped into the elevator and returned home.  After he did this, he said that he will give me the $15 back. This was before the holidays and I got in touch with him after the holidays. He told me he moved since then and we were tyring to figure out how to get the $15 back. He then came to the conclusion that he will cotnact Uber and let them know to refund this back to my credit card. He said not to worry and that he assures me this will be taken care of and the refund would be made.   I contacted Uber and there was a thread if 5 automated responses that they will not refund the fee, even after I went into detail with what the driver requested. I kept on receiving the same automated response from Uber.   I got in touch with the driver and he told me that he already contacted Uber regarding this. I got in touch with Uber and they were sending me the same automated reply.  It was a series of about 15 automated replies from Uber, each one failing to address the details of what I was asking for. I asked them if they have a record from the driver and each time, they refuse to look into this further.  I tried cotnacting my credit card company and I was told that I would need something in writing from the driver. I can;t get in touch with the driver anymore as hes not responding to a few voicemails.    The agreement was before he returned the lost item, that I would not be charged for this, since we lived at the same location.  The agreement was broken and I was scammed in the end. Uber is refusing to look into it and if they did, they would know that we lived at the same address. Also, the drive told me he already cotnacted Uber to reguest the refund to be put back on my credit card.    What to do?!"

0,"Isnt this outrageous?I am a graduate college student and wanted to try Lyft as a part time job. Ive been driving for a month now, and I am noticing some outrageous cuts by the company. I didnt want to clutter the page, so here are my last 5 rides, and most of them are this way.  **Ride 1**  Passenger Paid: $14.30  Lyft’s Cut: $5.53(**37%**)  My earnings: $8.77  **Ride 2**  Passenger Paid: $7.27  Lyft’s Cut: $4.10(**56%**)  My earnings: $3.17  **Ride 3**  Passenger Paid: $17.15  Lyft’s Cut: $5.95(**35%**)  My earnings: $11.20  **Ride 4**  Passenger Paid: $9.27(+$2 tip)  Lyft’s Cut: $4.90(**53%**)  My earnings: $4.37(+$2 tip)  **Ride 5**  Passenger Paid: $6.56  Lyft’s Cut: $3.56(**54%**)  My earnings: $3.00    Considering most of the rides are short and as a driver, considering you pay taxes, and for gas &amp; car maintenance with what your earn, it is even lower. How do full time people make money like this? I wish corporates wouldnt be as greedy. People could actually make a good living if their cuts werent as outrageous, and more people would want to drive. Would be a better solution instead of spending a lot of money trying to increase market share, paying your drivers fairly would be the best investment to increase market share in my opinion. This way its only going to drop, as it turned me off from driving."
0,"Should I have just taken the gum.....??In a Lyft right now, and everything’s going great, but the driver (nice guy, nothing against him) offered me gum and seemed almost surprised that I didn’t take it.

0,Service animals but not unaccompanied minorsLyft keeps sending out periodic emails about how we must accept passengers who have service animals yet they send nothing about unaccompanied minors.

0,"Quick Question About Airport RunHey guys.    I did my first two airport runs tonight.    First was a group of 2 passengers.    They got in my lyft and i noticed it said something that it was a shared ride or maybe the new version of the ""lyft line""     I was expecting a nice commission because I know as a user of lyft and uber from the airport its always more expensive.    I got like $3.69 for a 10ish min trip   My next airport run (immediately after that one) was about a 25 min drive from the airport. Again same ""lyft line"" or ""lyft share"" status under the passengers name near pickup location. I was also expecting a nice little chunk of commission on this ride because Ive done similar 25-30 minute rides as a customer from the airport where I pay around 30-35$ for a lyft.      At the end of the ride I got around $9.45.      If i multiple to get an hour 9.45 \* 2=18.9   and 3.69\*6=22.14    Obviously thats not a very accurate portrayal, but I guess my question is ... is this normal amount of compensation for the airport runs? did the passengers select ""lyft line"" or w.e and bank on me not getting another pax to in a sense ""game the system""     honestly the stress of going through the airport parking and helping the passengers load/unload their stuff...id rather just not do airport runs and make the same money.

I like going to the gym but dont have a license and my dad always gets mad when I uber because its a fucking rip off. I think I found a solution. WHY DONT I PAY THE UBER DRIVER DIRECTLY??? So I order an uber, and cancel immediately. Then I call the driver I cancelled on and just ask if I give him cash directly if he could take me to the gym!!! I want to give this a try. UBER Is a fucking scam, and I feel for these drivers. This way, uber gets fucked, and now the passenger and driver take The W. Ima a genius. Uber can fuck themselves. cause ima just use their app, for free! and they wont get a single penny!! thank god. Let me know what you think. Instead of paying 12 dollars that uber charges, I can just give the driver 10 so I save money. Works well if you go far to like LA.  TLDR: Order über, cancel, and then just ask the driver to take you to the gym (or wherever you need to go) without using the uber app, so Uber gets no money, because their company is a fucking scam and I want to make it easier for all the drivers. let me know. This way I can just give money directly to the driver so he doesnt lose 20 percent to uber. and he gains more money for All he does."

Just email Lyft and they can probably find the owner through your previous driver and his previous passengers.   Tom: Okay. Sorry man.   So I take him to his destination without saying another word. Then this morning, as Im cleaning out the car, of course, I find the keys on the floor. I shouldve known.

What kind of backwards logic, and immaturity is that?   What kind of professional driver has that kind of an attitude?  Does Uber not care or consider the person they are hiring aside from driving records and general car appearances?  Uber drivers are paid to do a service, why do they constantly seem like they are acting like they are doing the client a favor?  And we as consumers should have control and accountability for drivers who want to downvote us for trivial / personal/ ridiculous reasons.  "

1,"Problem requesting Uber’sOdd problem I can’t find the solution to on help forums. I’ve been using uber for a few years now and never had trouble. Currently I can use uber to request UberEats off my phone and laptop. But can only request uber rides off of my laptop and not my smartphone(which is an iPhone 6) I used the exact same payment method and exact same trip for both but only was able to on my laptop.  While using my smartphone I experienced the “Oops, something went wrong and we couldn’t process your request”  I have tried logging out of the app, reentering my payment information and nothing changes.  Any help would be great, thanks!  Edit: my app is up to date Edit 2: I do not believe my number has been blocked, I never received a notification of that, also my rating is a 4.83"

1,"Can’t sign in because my mobile number already in use (by me!)Sorry if this is the wrong sub but I’m stumped on a problem I have.   Problem started about two weeks ago  When I try to request a ride the app prompts me to update my mobile number  I enter mobile number and 4 digit code that gets texted to me  I get an error that my mobile number is already in use (yes, by me, since 2013) and can’t be transferred to another account.   The uber helpsite is not user friendly at all, and of course no phone number so throwing a Hail Mary to help diagnose the real problem.  I’ve been using lyft exclusively while uber is failing me, but I’d rather fix it as uber is usually about 10% cheaper and more available in my market.    For what it’s worth, I had several false charges that ended up getting reversed, and I think the problem was triggered once those credits were issued. "

Bogus.   I took one trip to pick up a spare tire for my car that had a flat. Then another trip after selling my car to a dealership. Everything was cordial during each ride so I dont understand.

1,"Sick of Uber Drivers giving attitude for things riders have no control overMy car is in the shop so I’ve been ubering to work which is 1.9 miles away as well as other errands. I also have a promotion on my Uber right now that is giving me 50% off rides for a week or more. I can’t tell you how much attitude I’ve gotten from tons of drivers. First of all, I can’t walk 2 miles to work in 20 degree weather. Second of all, I have no control over who got pinged. If you had to drive 10 minutes to get me take that up with Uber not the passenger. Some people have outright told me “I drove ten minutes to get you” and grumbled about it for the trip. A few drivers have left me waiting for 10-15 minutes in the cold then cancelled on me last minute. Today, the guy was rude the entire time, drove the car angrily and jerkily, then dropped me off on the wrong side of the road and also not where requested then sped off. This is unprofessional, unnecessary, and blames the customer for using a service that keeps you employed. I am a good tipper, I am polite, and I am respectful. This type of behavior leaves me ready to leave a one star review and no tip. Is that worth it for a quick cheap ride that you can move on from? So fucking sick of it. I’m spending $400-$500  plus every month on Uber and am tired of people taking their frustrations that are due to the company out on me. Rant over. "

1,"To Solve Ubers Driver/Passenger confirmation problem.**Problem:** Passengers need an added verification step when entering a vehicle regardless of them confirming the Drivers name and Tag. This functionality should be adhoc and queued by the Passenger when he/she feels unsafe, travelling alone, in an unsafe location when booking a ride. This functionality is **not** present on all rides and only prompted to both the Driver (upon pickup) and by the Passenger when the Passenger requests enhanced verification when booking their ride in the Uber app.    **Solution:** The Uber App (kind of like two-factor authentication) will generate a passphrase only visible to the Driver and Passenger, something like Toasted Walnuts (a randomly generated phrase or saying). The passenger when entering the vehicle should verify 1. Drivers name, 2. Tag number, 3. Request the pass-phrase from Driver. If generated pass-phrase is not provided or is incorrect, Uber passengers should not enter vehicle as this does not pass their requested enhanced verification needs.    **Benefits:** This provides added security for the passenger as a way to verify their driver. Adds security for the Driver to ensure they are picking up the right individual (danger is a two-way street).   Provides Uber a tracking mechanism to begin trending: 1. Where is the volume of unsafe or potentially unsafe requests are coming from in any given geographical area and more importantly at what time, 2. Increased Passenger/Driver protection functionality, 3. Proactive gauge on Drivers who cancel or reject Enhanced Verification Rides. 4. Maybe: Enhanced Verification rides for Ubers top drivers by rating, # of rides (developed trust).  \-- I can only imagine that if this functionality was in place, it would provide an added measure of security to the women of this world who rely on Uber (thank you) but also need to know the Driver they are getting in the car with is a safe, reputable, trustable Uber driver."

It then asked me to give a star rating to the driver. I didnt want to be bothered with that so I just closed the app.  Then a few days later in reviewing my credit card purchases online, I realized that the tip was never added. So I brought up the Lyft app and added a tip to that now-past ride.  If thats the way the app is supposed to work, I wonder how many Lyft drivers are missing out on tips."

Should it be completely crack-free or does a small one not matter? Truck just passed inspection 2 weeks ago. Also any advice for a new driver is welcome.  Edit 1: Well, I had also messaged lyft support and asked them basically this exact post. I was told in the Houston region a 1.5 cab truck works perfectly fine for their requirements.

We are almost there when our uber says he forgot to grab his mom something and pulls over at a Safeway and runs in and says he will be 5 mins and for us to get out of the car. My girlfriend is missing a leg due to an accident and we are parked the farthest from the store entrance. (Only spot available)  I told him Id like him to drop us off at the entrance  because it is unsafe to get her across the parking lot with what we had. He refused and said the ride isnt over and we can wait by his car until he is done. WTF? My girl felt super awkward and said shed wait the 5 mins and then cancel if he wasnt there so she wouldnt have to walk herself across the lot. We brought her crutches because the store has those electric carts she can sit in and we didnt know if her wheelchair would fit in some cars. She ordered the uber and refused to report him but I am very pissed. Yes she chose to wait but a driver should have never put her in that position. She is too shy and ashamed to tell the driver she was not prepared and physically able to stand that long. This is like my 4th time using uber. Is this fuking common?

0,"Would you ditch Uber/Lyft ifThere’s an investor on the fence about investing a modest amount of money for me to start a company similar to Uber/UberEats. I have talked to small businesses and corporate and they are all willing to ditch Uber and similar platforms like Grubhub.   I am planning on starving both companies of drivers by paying 2-3x more on a per ride basis while getting rid of most thrills like discounts. The biggest issue is I need to know the fastest and cheapest way to tell other drivers and have them sign up for no sign on bonus (I’m not made of billions of investor money here).  Ultimately I think drivers are the most important part of the puzzle yet customers are greasy as God’s. If I own a monopoly on drivers, my theory is I can jack up rates and customers will have no choice. If I pay drivers more, they will be more loyal to me and won’t ditch me even if Uber and Lyft increase prices, because they know those companies don’t care about them. The plan is to raise $5 million for a SuperBowl commercial to hook drivers and tell riders come tomorrow morning, all the rideshare drivers are moving over to this app so if you want a ride, you need to download this app. The commercial would also call for drivers to delete both Uber and Lyft from their phones. This will draw free press. It’s crucial that a significant amount of drivers switch at the same time otherwise I will run out of money. This company in a way will be the drivers union, guarding against predatory actions. If I can hold a monopoly on drivers, I then theoretically can starve the others into deep loses. Lyft should fall first since it has basically no other revenue stream and relies entirely on the US market. Uber will have enough cash on hand to hold out but as long as drivers don’t defect, they will fall a year or two later. Uber may in a last gulp of air, throw all its money into autonomous cars.   This company will be lean, no expensive self driving car research, no ridiculous executive compensation. The bulk of money will go towards operations and support.  What would it take for you to personally ditch both Uber/Lyft/Via/DoorDash/Instacart for a completely new company?   New company would offer -Legally binding clause guarantying no price cuts for 3 years unless voted on by 60% of drivers. -20% flat rideshare commission for normal drivers -10% flat commission for drivers with over 1000 rides every 3 months   Shared Ride rates Base rate: $1.50 Cancel penalty: $5 Wait time: 90 seconds Max rate: $300 Min rate: $5 Per mile: $1.20 Per min: $0.35 Scheduled cancellation: $10  Regular ride rates Base rate: $1.50 Cancel penalty: $5 Wait time: 3:30 Max rate: $400 Min rate: $5 Per mile: $1.00 Per min: $0.30 Scheduled cancellation: $10  XL ride rates Base rate: $2.00 Cancel penalty: $5 Wait time: 3:30 Max rate: $400 Min rate: $7 Per mile: $1.50 Per min: $0.40 Scheduled cancellation: $10  Lux ride rates Base rate: $3 Cancel penalty: $7 Wait time: 3:30 Max rate: $500 Min rate: $10 Per mile: $1.90 Per min: $0.45 Scheduled cancellation: $10  Black car ride rates Base rate: $5 Cancel penalty: $7 Wait time: 3:30 Max rate: $500 Min rate: $20 Per mile: $2.25 Per min: $0.65 Scheduled cancellation: $10  Black SUV ride rates Base rate: $10 Cancel penalty: $7 Wait time: 3:30 Max rate: $500 Min rate: $25 Per mile: $2.25 Per min: $0.75 Scheduled cancellation: $10   Weekly power bonus  100 rides - $70 130 rides - $250 160 rides - $310 200 rides - $450  Drivers with 90%+ Acceptance rate bonus +$20 on each power bonus tier  Damage Max $350   Rating system overhaul No more 1-5 rating. Instead passengers will be presented a pass fail option. Each yes, will count as a single point, whereas each no is a negative point to form the drivers rating.  Did the driver complete the ride? Yes or no? Was the car clean? Yes or no? Do you want this driver in the future? Yes or no? Etc etc  Welcome back surge!  We believe in surge pricing. You can set filters as to which requests to automatically accept or decline based on surge percentage. If you set your rates to high compared to other drivers, you’ll see less action. If your rates are high but your the nearest driver, rider may opt to pay it.  Long pickups Riders in remote areas or in places with less drivers can agree to pay a flat rate to attract drivers to their location as an additional incentive. For example, if the nearest driver is 30 minutes away, we will recommend the rider offer $15 as an incentive for nearby drivers to agree to pick up their request. If no one agrees, the rider can choose to up the amount until equilibrium is reached.     Delivery rates for drivers 2 hour shift: $50 - $75 4 hour shift: $115 - $165 Per delivery: $1.99 - $14.99 Shifts are sent out on a who can tap and accept them first basis.          "

Rainy night.Last night in between events, I did a couple rides and this really cute girl was on the wrong Street from the pin spot standing on the corner in leather hot pants at like 6 in the morning in the cold n rain. I finally got her over to the car talk to her try to figure out what was going on all she could tell me where she been in some party, seemed mostly cognizant.  I took her to her car by the apps GPS, said goodnight, ended the ride. it was raining she waves I drive away I pick up the next customer whos another girl in her pajamas in the rain and young. And as Im driving that girl home the other girl calls me through the service and says she left her key fob in my car.  So the girl in the pajamas basically had her ride charged to drive back to drop the other girls key off to her hand, and now that girl is Happy. But she didnt care about the girl in pajamas losing a half an hour, me losing a couple rides or that girl getting charged.  I didnt know what to do, if I ended the pajama girls ride shed be stuck out in the rain but she wouldnt be charged.  If I kept her in the car her ride paid for the return of the other girls key fob, the girl that was half naked wearing leather hot pants in 40 degrees in the rain had to get that key. Two women both barely dressed in freezing cold, meanwhile every two seconds Im getting a a ride added to me because the second girl decided to take the cheap way of going home and Im not even sure whether I wanted to put any pool Riders from bus stops in downtown into the car with a girl in the pajamas.  It was just one of those nights you can only experience if youre a driver, where everything can go wrong and against you if you dont get it just right. Especially being a man.  Im just wondering whether the big company will understand anything you try to explain to them later. The girl in The PJs wound up stuck on like a hour ride because of add-on riders affecting her route, though I kept canceling them to try to get her home already.  And Lyft sees me taking weird long routes because of the 5 assignment rides changing lyfts idea of routing, while GPS is getting more confused on the route and assigning surface streets for the entire drive back instead of freeway.

What’s even more weird is I have my Pay Pal and my Apple Pay connected to my account not my actual bank card, and both of those need verification for a transaction to go through... started a support message and waiting for a response, wondering if anyone has had this happen today or ever? Only thing bank can do is close my card and give me a new one so I’ve locked my card and I’m waiting for Uber’s response. "
0,"Can you see the number of trips your driver has made like you can on Uber?Hi! Going to be taking a Lyft instead of an Uber but have a safety concern. When using Uber I can always see the number of previous rides my driver has done, i.e. it will say ""4.5 stars has done 1,000 rides"". If I can see an Uber driver has done a significant amount of trips I feel safer.  Does Lyft work the same way? Thank you."
1,"Mess charge with no mess???Hello I’ll keep it short and simple;   THE STORY: A couple days ago (Wednesday the 27th) I ordered an Uber from a bar we left early cause it was boring 4 people and myself hopped into an uber the guy was nice enough to drive 5 of us, even though his car could only hold 4. Ride went fine no problems it was 1 mile in total about 3 minutes in driving. This morning I opened up my email to find I’m being charged 80 dollars for an incident (spill or vomit or something)  Now I know this is BS because I checked the front seat and the back seat to make sure nobody left keys or phones no mess to be seen I also confirmed with the whole party there was no problem.   THE QUESTION: can I get this nonsense charge refunded? How long will it take? How can I prevent this from happening again aside from driving myself?  SOLVED: After acouple back and forth emails with an uber representative they sent picture (which can be found in the comments below) showing ice cubes on the seat of the car, I responded asking for a time stamp on the photo and they immediately Refunded my money and apologized for the issue."
0,rumor on youtube. uber now has longer wait times? also des mode paying 30 % less ?i have not been out driving in about 5 days . .     youtube is saying now uber has a longer wait time.  also des mode paying 30% less ?      i hope its not in my market.  that 30 % less would be pointless .  were hardly making any money right now  in some markets.

1,"Absolutely terrible experience in progress.My wife and I got off our honeymoon about an hour ago and were taking an uber to where we parked our car a few miles away. Its in Miami and there is a marathon today on the exact road we parked our car which is unfortunate for us. My complaints begin with the fact that our driver has tried to get around the marathon about four times and each time keeps running into the marathon. After he gave that up he proceeded to try the first road again which you guessed it is still blocked. The next problem I have with this is that our driver doesnt speak any English so we cant really communicate efficiently with him that the road is closed until after 10 (its 9 while Im writing this been sitting here about 20 minutes). On top of the fact we cant communicate with him well, he has headphones in both of his ears. Im exhausted, hungry, and just want to get home.   Edited to add: We tried several times to explain to the driver there was an alternative route suggested by the event to get where we needed to be. He couldnt understand us/ didnt listen to us to get that information. It wouldve taken thirty minutes to get where we needed to be. Instead it took two hours. Again we attempted to communicate this to our driver he just couldnt or wouldnt listen. "
0,"Didnt realize your drunk goggles were that severe.So last night I went out for a drive after I got off of work like I normally do on weekends. Now, to preface, I live in OKC which is super spread out and has multiple smaller town surrounding the metro area. (If you pull up Google maps, all the towns I talk about will make a whole lot more sense in terms of distance) Before this particular pick up, I was headed back to my house which is in the northern part of the metro area just south of Edmond. I got the notification, accepted the ride, and started to head to the pick up destination. I got there and the guy I was picking up had 2 other guys standing with him because he was so drunk he apparently couldnt figure out lyft for himself anymore. I pulled up, they said their goodbyes, he starts fumbling around my car, and the 2 guys walked off. As soon as he got himself to the other side of my car, he opens the door and this guy, of course, picked my passenger seat to sit in. Im already uncomfortable, as a woman, picking up a very drunk man let alone having him sit in the seat right next to me but Im not going to make him get up and move again cause it was already hard enough for him to get to the other side of my car. It took a cool minute for him to buckle but he eventually gets there. The liquor on his breath was so strong I could basically taste. Unfortunately for me, he was a chatty drunk and to make matters worse, I had to take him from what is basically Edmond all the way the Norman. A 40 minute drive...God help me. He starts relaying the evenings events and from what I could tell, by the way he spoke, this guy was quite an unsavory character. He takes every chance he can get to stroke his ego and Im trying so hard not to laugh at every word that comes out this guys mouth. At some point he pulls the, ""Im not a rasict, but..."" card and we all know thats just the biggest red flag but I still just kept on trucking along. At some point in his babbling, he gets on the topic of movies and we start having a conversation about the ones we like and out of nowhere he asks me if I wanted to watch one with him...""As friends."" I immediately declined and lie to try and get out of the situation asap. It makes him a little upset that shot him down but Im not trying to die from stupidity of my own accord. I finish the ride and leave. Looking back at the whole thing, I probably should have ended the ride a lot sooner instead of enduring it but Im broke and $22 is more money in my pocket. "
0,I think I left my phone in my drivers car and he left himself a 200% tip on itI cant find my phone but an hour ago I got an email saying I tipped my driver 13.86 on a 1-mile ride that cost 6.93. I obviously didnt tip 13.86; did someone put that amount in intentionally?

Please consider it payment for the stop at the gas station, and then when they didnt have your favorite brand of smokes, the seven eleven - where you so generously bought me this 12 pack. When we arrived at the first stop marked on the app, after those other ones - so you could get your blow or whatever - I figured you were tough enough to get where you were going without me. So I did you a favor and cancelled the ride after ya jumped ship, and went on home.   Next time, wear ya seatbelt, dont threaten ya drivah, and dont leave ya beeyah in the car. "
0,"Its so annoying when destination mode doesnt work correctlyI mainly set the destination to downtown (about 50 min away) and then back to home when the nights over. Multiple times now, Ive gotten pings from people going nowhere near my set destination. I get all excited when I accept a ping thinking the pax is going downtown when its actually a min fare ride to the fucking grocery store in the opposite direction. The long ride notification used to be a nearly certain way for me to know a pax was headed to my set destination but even that doesnt show up most of the time now. Ive canceled several rides because of this but I dont want my rating to tank. "
1,"Drivers who expect a tip...if you show up to my actual apartment, not down the street, your car doesnt reek like shit, you dont drive like a fucking moron, and you drop me off where i need to be, that doesnt qualify you as deserving of a tip. thats the basic level of service im expecting. to expect otherwise is crazy. now, if youre insanely nice, provide good conversation, but know when to back off and let me ride or let me and my partner chat without you butting in, youre a safe driver with a clean car, and maybe you go out of your way to provide water, gum, or a phone charger THEN youve reached that next plateau. at that point, tips are in the discussion. dont just expect one because you picked me up in your fucking toyota camry and didnt kill me on my way to my destination lol."
0,"My driver was super rude and racistJust got off from lyft. The driver shouted at me because I asked him to drop me from the back door which I ask every driver everyday and no one seems to have a problem with it. But he shouted at me and told me that he will drop me where the gps will tell him when the gps for this location is always weird, I have to tell the drives. He continued driving, I asked him to drop me in the middle of the street. I got off and closed the door a little harshly because I was super mad and already late for work. He then got off the car and shouted on me IN THE MIDDLE OF THE STREET that ""this is not pakistan or Saudi that you can do like this"". Because I was wearing a scarf. "

0,"Seasoned Lyft Drivers are the best.Just a quick shout out to the Lyft drivers that take the time to feel you out to see if you want to talk or not. I dont mind a little push, but if I resist and you feel that and just let me be, or you see that I want to talk and we talk. I DIG that because that comes with some hard time and I appreciate that.     Also, this dude blew my mind because it was the best way to say goodbye. He said right as I left, ""Phone, keys, wallet?"" and I said, ""Yep!"" and hes like, ""alright, take care.""       Goodbyes are hard and this dude got a ten out of ten with that exit.     So if you dudes out there grinding are reading this and youre like, ""This is me!"" Thank you.   And if there someone out there like, ""oh this could be me.."" Let it be! You can do it!   Bye now. "

Im newer to the app, have only been taking a few rides the last few days."
1,"I cannot log into my account. Might be 2FA mobile number changed.So I am trying to get my account set up on Uber and everything goes well until it asks for my e-mail, to tell me its in use. Great! Means I made an account before and dont need to do the whole deal again.   Issue #1: app doesnt let me log in. Only asks for my number ""or connect with social"" which after some data entering and sms verifying tells me my e-mail address is in use and were back to the start. So I go on to pray to my lord and savior Google, and find nothing relevant. I then get the greatest idea: log onto Uber through my browser to see if my old phone number is the one registered, then try and change it.  Issue #2: 2-factor authentication. So i make it through the login spiel, learning I am definitely not a robot in the process, until it asks for my SMS verification code. My SMS inbox is silent. Must mean it tried to send it to the old number, which is long disabled by now.  So here I am, having tried almost nothing and having no idea what to do. Am I missing something or did I just TIFU my way into getting locked out of my Uber account?  I should point out its nothing terribly serious. I had no cards associated with the old account as I had never used it before, and all I wanted was to have this specific e-mail associated to my Uber account. Ill be making a new account with another e-mail address. Just wanna know if I can somehow recover it because it would make my life easier to have it under the same address as all my ""serious"" accounts."
0,"Tip QuestionIm a passenger with a question about tips.  If I tip thru the app do drivers have to wait to get the money?  Does Lyft take a cut of it/report it to the IRS?

If its less convenient for the drivers to get tipped thru the app Ill know to be extra vigilant about having cash for tips.    Thank you! "
1,Its nice to know after 11 months that these bugs still exist. 
0,"uber pro tip.ok here is the deal.   you show up to get a pax. there is a gate that is blocking you.  you can not get close to start the timer. the pax does not answer the phone.  you can not call uber until you cancel the ride or its over . if you cancel it now uber will not see it in your account meaning you will not get paid for the cancel.  so the best thing you can do in this situation so you get a paid cancel fee. drive at least 50 feet after  starting the ride  then end the ride. then call uber  tell them the name of the pax the ride will show zero miles and be recorded they will not be able to rate you after calling uber,  and request your cancel fee.    hope this helps some of you out. and if i spelled words incorrectly or did not use caps and you do not like it go blank blank. thanks."
1,Why aren’t passengers eating the candy I put out?I bought some Hershey’s kisses &amp; made them accessible to backseat passengers. I did it to hopefully improve my tip &amp; rating.Only one passenger took one. Now I don’t mention ANYTHING about tips &amp; rating to the pax. I also don’t ask them if they want any candy because that’s overkill &amp; I assume they know it’s for them. Why aren’t they eating the candy?
1,"How my worst Uber experiance as a driver made me come to a dark realization about myself.I picked up a pax on a cold winter day and it initially seemed like a typical drive. I was driving on a high traffic 60 mph road. All of a sudden the pax rolled down the window and puked their guts out several times. The roads were bad and I was unable to slow down or pull over. The speed created a vomit tornado in my car. It got everywhere including my face and hair. I made the decision to finish the ride because I was worried for the paxs safety due to the cold. I was obviously unhappy about the situation, but I wasnt filled with anger. I was just sad. I drop the pax off and he says hes embarrased and hell make it up to me. He hands me a twenty. He then says I have a hundred but I dont think this is worth it. I roll my eyes. I spent at least 6 hours cleaning, including going into walmart with puke on me to get cleaning supplies. After all of this I was mad at myself for not getting mad and staying calm the whole time. I realized this is why I never can seem to get ahead in life. All my successful family and friends would have gotten verbally angry and kicked the pax out, not giving a flip about their safety. It makes me realize I dont have what it takes to be successful and never will. I will always be chill and put others first even at my detriment. "

Can I send a message they will see before they pick me up?  Drivers, what would work best for you?

Most of my rides are quiet, and I like a good conversation every once in a while but not every rider! Its too much, too many of the same questions and answers. My throat starts hurting. Also I want to focus on the road, conversation can really be distracting at times. And Im an introvert, like roughly half of the drivers you will have. Your silence is not awkward, just say hello and do something on your phone. Or if you really want to talk, lead the way. Otherwise, this is my perfect ride:  \*Greetings fellow human, let me take you where you want to go!\*  ...music plays...  \*Ok, we are here! Live your best life, fare thee well! &lt;3\*"

This doubled our rate, leaving us with no recourse other than the customer service email. We were unable to do anything as we had to go through security screening.  /u/lyft I was hoping to find a way to talk to someone or further the request for review.

1,Uber directing to me to toll roadsHi all.   So maybe I’m a little to new to this but here it goes:  So I was driving in Southern California where there are toll roads 241/261/73. The Uber app (mind you this was before picking up my passenger) told me to take the toll road to get to my passenger. After the ride I noticed that I wasn’t given a toll fee and I thought to myself I took the toll because the Uber app told me to take it. So here’s my issue.   1) why is uber telling me to take the toll road while knowing I will not be reimbursed for taking a toll on the way to pick up a fare.   2) if I take side streets (which I can program in another app like google maps) I can get there but if may take me 10 minutes longer. However Uber app is advertising I’ll be there in 5 minutes.   My problem is Uber advertising to you that you’ll be there in x amount of minutes because they directed you into a toll road that YOU’RE paying out of pocket. So is it possible they can add that option or by default leave the toll option OFF when picking up a passenger by default?

Of course, its not without its fair share of headaches, slow days, and crazy passengers, but all in all its been a good experience. Ive enjoyed driving so much, in fact, that I decided to do my thesis project for college on rideshare companies and driver communities in particular.  A HUGE part of this project is research, and as part of that research, Ive put together a short survey, and I would be so grateful to ANY DRIVERS out there from this group who could take the time to complete it. The survey should take no more than 10 minutes to complete, and any answers given will remain completely anonymous and confidential. Lastly, one lucky participant will win a $25 gas card!  My goal is never to spam anyone in this group, but, rather, to get input from all of you so that I can learn more about what you love about driving, what you wish was different, what matters most to you and what keeps you coming back to Lyft and others.

I 5 stard him and amply tipped him... But really? 🤔🤨🧐 Why drive in ""this shit"" is what lingered on my tongue the whole trip and what I held back asking him... Why choose to drive and then bitch about it? Cant you just turned off your app? I mean the drivers around me were aplenty, there wasnt even a surge despite the awful weather (which is why I tipped excessively, because I DO recognize and appreciate the risks you drivers take) but seriously...

0,Thefuk? I notice the pink zones in San Diego (used to be prime time indicators) don’t have any primetime applied to the rides- are these just “busy indicators” now or is there a problem with the app? None of the ride requests in the pink areas have prime time on them...

0,"Lyft needs to stop allowing passengers to contact drivers after the transaction is overIn last week or so Ive had two passengers who I waited for past the required five minutes, attempted to call with no answer, and left. After I left, I begin receiving texts and calls from dummy phone numbers asking where I am and if I left. Its intrusive. The transaction is over, they didnt come to the ride they requested, and Ive moved on in exact adherence to Lyfts policies.   The only way a passenger should be able to reach out once they havent appeared for the requested ride is to Lyft support, not bombarding my personal cell phone for me to explain to them why I couldnt sit waiting for them while obstructing traffic for ten minutes.

I cancel and try to get one several times and he continues to accept each time. I finally go up to him and tell him to stop and he tries to convince us to fit. He was an asshole about it and basically cussed me out and said he would report me for not taking his uber. He said I was discriminating against him. Anyway he finally leaves and I get an actual XL.  Is there a way to report him? I saved his info. Also is there not rules for the type of vehicle that can be listed as XL? I know all trucks can max fit 5 passengers.

Drive well and drive with intent and safety.   6. If you don’t like being a driver, don’t turn app on. You must like interacting with people. This applies to pax as well.   7. Left lane is passing lane.  8. 5 star every time for pax and driver unless something is actually, really wrong.  9. Tip. I mean wtf. If you have luggage. If driver has to wait.

1,"Double charge still on my bank account after almost 2 months. On January 10th I took a ride that cost $13.07 with my PayPal account, I found out the next time I went to take a ride that it didnt go through and I needed to use another payment method to pay for the trip. I used my Debit card to pay for it and it went through. I saw double charges on my bank account, one for Pinless, and one for PayPal.  I was expecting one of them to go away in the next few days, safe to say it didnt. On January 14th both payments officially posted to my bank account, so the next day I sent a message to Uber support and got this back ""It appears the issue you are experiencing is already under investigation. We appreciate your patience as we work hard to resolve this issue as soon as possible."" So I gave it a week and on the 26th asked for updates and got this message ""Were still looking into this issue. Well be sure to check back in with you once weve got a solution. Thank you again for your understanding and patience"" So I said fine, Ill give them the time to figure this out. Fast forward to a month later I sent a message to support and got this clearly generic message ""Uber places an authorization hold at the start of every trip, including trips that are later canceled. This is a standard practice to confirm that your card has enough funds to cover the fare. Youve been charged only the actual fare of 13.07 for this trip. Since Uber has already released the hold, the authorization amount should soon be released by your bank. This typically happens within a few business days."" Meanwhile this trip took place last month, it doesnt take an authorization hold almost 2 months to clear, Ive never had that happen before. They are saying they voided it on the 10th, yet when I messaged them 4 days after it happened they said "" the issue is under investigation"" Even my bank are saying both payments have cleared to my account and they cant do anything from their end.   Sorry for the long message, but I have no idea what to do now.  "

0,"We are ALL getting #liftedbylyftHi All,  As a former Lyft driver and current Lyft rider, I have some massive grievances with the illegal pricing tactics used by the company. Today, in the mail, I received my $3 and change for the settlement of a Lyft Class Action Lawsuit which had them admitting to price fixing and robbing drivers of 100% of their primetime fares.  I realized that drivers were being cheated when I drove on New Years and happened to ask my riders what they were paying for their rides, and soon saw that i wasnt making anywhere near my 75% commission (even after factoring in the Los Angeles city fees of $2.10 put on top of every ride).  # I made $23.97 on a $36.38 ride, a dismal 65% commission. (Ride #23 in picture below)  Over a year ago, I spoke and met with many of Los Angeles top lawyers directly because of the evidence I have that supports the nationwide lawsuit against Lyft that was filed in New Jersey for Price Fixing and cheating their drivers out of their hard-earned pay ([https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/business/Lyft-Drivers-Say-Theyre-Getting-Shortchanged-by-the-Company-468282433.html?amp=y](https://www.nbcdfw.com/news/business/Lyft-Drivers-Say-Theyre-Getting-Shortchanged-by-the-Company-468282433.html?amp=y)) + ([https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Fare-Fraud-Lyft-Drivers-Say-Theyre-Getting-Shortchanged-by-the-Company-465572743.html?amp=y](https://www.nbclosangeles.com/news/local/Fare-Fraud-Lyft-Drivers-Say-Theyre-Getting-Shortchanged-by-the-Company-465572743.html?amp=y)).  Unfortunately, no one in California wanted to take on the big ride-sharing giant because New jersey was already trying to.  Unfortunately for this lawsuit though, it fell massively short because it only covered drivers that opted out of the Lyft user agreement within their first few months of use (aka .0001% of drivers), and left out the rest of the 99.99% of US.  My question to the Lyft and Reddit communities is why hasnt ANYONE heard about any of this?  Why hasnt LYFT taken any hit for this in the media and news?  Why hasnt a NATIONAL, FEDERAL TRIAL taken place to investigate every single transaction that Lyft has ever done to ensure that they havent been penny-shaving on each and every one of them? We are talking about billions of transactions where they can be shaving pennies or even dollars!  I contacted the city attorneys office directly. They said they were going to try and do something about it and that they know about it. Nothing happened.  So here I am, reporting the data myself for the reddit community to see.  Below you will find an image of 30 rides, tallied up using Data that both I was given in the app (Total driver earned APP column) and Data that a Lyft customer service representative gave me under a legal recording (total passenger pay ACTUAL column).  If any of you try to ask Lyft what your passenger paid for their ride, they wont tell you. And we know the reason why. It took 10 customer service calls for one employee to literally go through each of these 30 rides and tell me EXACTLY what the passenger paid. After telling him what I got paid and doing the appropriate math with him, needless to say, he was perplexed and in awe. He had no explanation for where the extra dollars and pennies went after we factored out the $2.10 Safety and Transportation fees that the company collects in Los Angeles. I wasnt making 25% on this leftover amount, and it was going straight to the company on every single transaction.  **So here is a key for you all for the table below:**  **Grey Column:** Taken straight from the APP  **Green:** ACTUAL DATA from either the APP or the LYFT EMPLOYEE)  **Beige:** What we, as drivers, are shown to believe what a Rider pays (ride payments+ lyft fee + prime + tips). This amount lets us see the LYFT percent-take-away as 25% quickly and leaves us happy as drivers.  **Red:** The discrepancy between what the customer actually paid and what i am shown/assumed to believe he paid.  **Yellow:** After factoring out the $2.10 imposed on every ride. Positive values indicate money that Lyft has pocketed. Negative values are rides where the rider ""underpaid"" and Lyfts cut was less than usual.  You will see many positive values in the yellow column going all the way up to $4.72 that was pocked by the company.  **CONCLUSION:**  **Lyft does not have a pricing/fare schedule for its riders by the mile/minute like traditional Taxis.**  **ONLY the drivers are contracted at a per mile &amp; minute rate, and therefore, Lyft takes the difference between what the user pays and what Lyft HAS to pay the driver.**  **QUESTION:**  **Who are these people that are overpaying v.s. underpaying? How does Lyft determine who will pay more for the same ride? Do they know the demographic and economic makeup of every customer to help them make that decision?**  **Is Any of this Legal?**  **WILL ANYONE DO ANYTHING?**  \#liftedbylyft  PS: If anyone has any other communities you think I should post this to, please let me know, as this is my first time on Reddit and dont know the ins and outs of it.  Thank you    EDITED:    FOR THOSE SAYING I DONT HAVE THE PROOF THEY WANT: I dont care. This is the proof. EVERYTHING is admissible in court.     For those saying this is all very clear in the TOS:   So why did lyft pay out in the lawsuit? Oh its because GROSS MANIPULATORY PRACTICES VOID ANY AND ALL ToS agreements.  When you steal you lose your right to be protected by a ToS.    SO YES, they STOLE, by not BEING CLEAR and for FABRICATING the data on our screens to so that we believe in the 75% marketing tool they have used for us drivers.    # BELOW YOU WILL FIND RIDE RECEIPTS AS A PASSENGER to show to all of you SHILLS that no, LYFT makes NO attempt at being ""CLEAR"" or ""FORTHCOMING"" about what they charge.  One night i spent 3 hours and $150 of my time taking 25 rides back and forth from the same location just to prove what i was talking about.  THESE ARE TWO RIDES 10 MINUTES APART, and LYFT reports them differently to you.  SO YES- THEY HAVE LIED TO EVERY PASSENGER SIMPLY BY EVEN STATING THAT THEY PAID A LYFT FARE, let alone that one of them DOESNT even show the service fee.  AND LASTLY, i have attached the settlement resolution I obtained in the mail this week. But i guess this doesnt mean Lyft did anything wrong, right? Wake up, people.

0,"Lyft Driver Uses N Word; Lyft Responds Swiftlytl;dr on the bottom  I just wanted to share a personal experience my wife and I had yesterday that we thought should be made public to both remind us all that blatant racism is still very much a thing, and to commend Lyft for the manner in which they responded to what happened.  My wife and I were returning from vacation in Fort Lauderdale and ordered a Lyft to take us to the airport. Our driver Melinda, a middle-aged white woman, picked us up at the Westin Fort Lauderdale Beach Resort. When she arrived, she complained about us having two pieces of luggage and said we had to put one in her backseat while one of us had to sit up front. She did not want both in her trunk for some reason (even though it appeared both would fit). No big deal, so I sat up front.  I immediately noticed that she was deviating from the GPS suggested route. As her chosen route only added three minutes or so to the estimated trip, I again thought to my self, no big deal. When we got stuck in tremendous traffic, the GPS ETA increased tremendously. I suggested that she make a left hand turn per the GPS suggestion and I pointed at it. She snapped at me to ""get my finger out of her face"" (it wasnt close to her, but again, maybe she is having a bad day and I brushed it off). She reluctantly went left after a few more minutes of going nowhere.  Then...it happened. As we were driving, we came upon what appeared to have been a fender bender in the left lane. A black woman got out of the passenger side of the front vehicle and began to yell at the driver of the vehicle behind her. Out of nowhere, Melinda yelled at to the woman to ""get back in your car nigger!"". My wife and I froze with shock. Before either of us could say or do anything, she proceeded to double down on her racism by saying ""I call them that when they act like that. And THATs why I didnt want to go this way!""  A few minutes later, we were at the airport, still too shocked to absorb the event. We thought about confronting her, but thought the better of it knowing there was little that we can say or do to this walking pile of trash to make any difference whatsoever. Once checked in for our flight, we still couldnt get over it, so we decided to contact Lyft and let them know of our experience.  Upon telling our story, we were immediately transferred to their Safety department and were assured they would start an investigation and that our fare would be refunded (which we werent fishing for, but appreciated). The person we spoke to took it very seriously and promised they would get back to us.  I knew that this would be a ""he said/she said"" situation. Even though I know what happened here, I generally do not believe anyone should lose their job over one persons unproven allegations. It would be a bad overall policy that one stranger can cause another to lose their job over an allegation that cannot be proven. I just expected Lyft to investigate the driver and to document the event so that if something like this happened in the future, they could establish a history/pattern.  Within 24 hours, we received multiple email updates and phone calls regarding Lyfts investigation. The drivers account was immediately suspended pending the investigation. Lyft spoke with other passengers of this driver and carefully reviewed the comments made about the driver over her history with Lyft. In the end, their investigation revealed the driver has actually exhibited racist behavior during other trips in the past. It was clear to Lyft that this driver had committed violations of their anti-discrimination policies and as a result, have terminated her. We were repeatedly thanked for reporting it as they have no way of knowing about these sorts of things without reports. Because of our report, they were able to find others that had similar experiences with Melinda.  We want to publicly thank Lyft for the seriousness with which they took this. Had their investigation revealed no other incidents, we would have been satisfied simply knowing that Lyft took appropriate actions. While some may see this not a big deal and not something someone should lose their job over, we do not believe there is any room in this world for that type of behavior. Thank you Lyft.  tl;dr Lyft driver calls black woman the n word, says she calls them that when they act like that, Lyft performs immediate investigation, reveals pattern of racist behavior, terminates Lyft driver"

1,"I think Uber is trying to rip me off?I took an Uber from Washington Dulles airport into Arlington early Friday morning using UberPOOL. A couple of hours after my ride, I got an email saying I was going to be charged an additional $20 for tolls. It doesn’t make sense - as far as I know, there is one toll road between Dulles and Arlington and the toll is definitely not $20. Not to mention that there were two other riders with me.   I have a feeling that the driver knew I wasn’t from the area and charged the additional $20 in tolls. He called me while I was waiting asking me where I was going and you could clearly tell I wasn’t familiar with the area.  I’ve messaged Uber via the app and twitter but I feel like I’m getting canned responses saying that the fare is within their estimates but no one is giving me a clear answer why I was charged $20 in tolls when there were two other riders in the car with me.  What can/should I do?"

1,"The quality of Uber drivers is getting worseIt used to be that most Uber drivers were friendly and good drivers but lately this seems to be going downhill. Riders really need to report any issues with the bad drivers they experience and also rate them low. This is the only way they can be eventually kicked off the platform so that we can then expect the overall caliber of the drivers to go up.   The more riders give bad drivers a pass for things like being rude, dangerous driving, etc, the more the caliber of the drivers will continue to go downhill. "

It took me 7-8 miles to get to the person and when I look at the breakdown it only counted the distance on her two stops and not what I drove to get there. It also counted the ""trip time"" as just the time from picking her up to dropping her off. They called it 6 miles 33 minutes but in actuality it was 50 minutes and 13 ish miles.

I was surprised to see an account balance that was $500 over what I would have expected it to be. I went through my transactions and realized that for the last month I have been getting Uber transactions every few days. Sometimes it would be multiple times a day. One day for example, there were 3 rides taken in one day that totalled up to $138. One of those trips alone was $80. The grand total ended up being $500. The best part is my account shows I havent taken a trip since June 12th 2018.  I contacted my credit card company and they have cancelled my card and sent out an investigation. Upon doing some research, I realized this happens quite frequently with Uber. I realize this was probably a simple case of credit card theft where someone somehow got my information and has been applying it to Uber, but still very frustrating."

Turns out the driver never picked him up but the app says that they were already making the trip.   So I called the driver, he ignored my call. Called him again, and sent me to voicemail. By this time Im mad as its charging me for a ride no ones even taking. I called him a third time and asked him what happened. He said what do you mean and I told him hes charging us for a ride but he never picked up my cousin. Hes like, oh Im sorry I forgot. Wtf?

Loga and Green will only control around 46% of the company, the rest of it will be controlled by Lyft executives and board members.  Can the freaking executive and board members think of the drivers and increase our pay? Giving us $10K for doing 20,000 rides isnt worth it, by 20,000 rides the driver is pretty much beat down and would need a Gym or may have developed some physical/mental issues after the 20K rides mark, so $10K for all that abuse beating and low pay is hardly worth it.  Heck a government medical study said ""Every disease man can get, can start in this cab!""  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC5709044/  https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4899329/  So the ones sitting in their luxury offices, working 8 hours with plenty of exercise and walking around for health are becoming millionaires overnight, but the drivers out there who are deteriorating are getting $10K for 20,000 rides.  hmmmmm sounds FARE.    Btw, I myself have driven one of the neighbors of Logan Green a few years ago that told me he just bought a $2M house and had twins born, and I mentioned a very annoying feature in Lyft and the neighbor passed it onto Logan and I noticed it got fixed a few days later, so why cant we as the driver have a percentage ownership of this company by default since we play a big part in running it? We should be on the board too for crying out loud.  We should have the right to conference call in during the board meetings.  In 2015 when this company was getting itself together, and figuring out what features to bring and improve on, I was freaking driving people back to back.  2016 I drove 6,000 people.  2017 shit went downhill and they started taking more of our pay and slashing prices.  Get ready for share prices to fall when drivers hit the news to complain of pay and mention a new strike coming."

Lyft is also the one renting out this car to the driver.  Its two weeks later and Lyft is STILL NOT cooperating with authorities.

Obviously he should have checked for passing traffic, but in terms of liability, would this accident be covered by Uber insurance, the taxi drivers insurance, my friends travel insurance, or any other insurance?  The motorcyclist is using one of those accident lawyer firms to try and sue my friend.   I know the Dutch are very hot when it comes to protecting (motor)cyclists.  Edit: just to clarify, he informed the travel insurance, the claimant also contacted him. Documents regarding travel insurance was passed on to the third party to help them if they needed to make a claim on their insurance. No further correspondence occured so he assumed the issue had been resolved, until today.

I haven’t ordered a Lyft in more than a year but I still had the app on my phone.  I don’t know what happened, but I looked at my app and it said that I was getting charged for two $5 cancellation fees.  There were all these auto texts from drivers saying they arrived and were waiting (at my address), and nonsense text replies.  I think my dog may have stepped on my phone and accidentally triggered the app to send rides.  I have just filed disputes with PayPal and Lyft.  Will this be a problem that I disputed with both?  I was just so pissed off about this, and about having no phone help with Lyft.  Update:  Lyft did give me a partial credit back for the cancellation fees.  And I was never trying to say the drivers should not get their compensation for their time—but just that the company ought to look into the ease of booking rides without going through consent steps.

1,"Uber driver wont take me home, wont let me cancel rideTl;DR - driver picked me up, but only had 20 minutes left that he was allowed to drive, and my trip was more than 20 minutes away. He wouldnt let me cancel the trip, but he also didnt seem willing to drive me either, and it turned into a 15 minute long ordeal where he got out of his car and followed me down the street as I tried to get another ride.    So, yesterday, after a 12 hour stressful day at work, I decided to take uber home. I work in DC, but I live out in the boonies, and metro typically takes about an hour and a half later in the evening, so I decided to splurge.  I request a ride, driver shows up. I get in. I cheerily say hi and tell him thanks for driving me out to Rockville.  As soon as I say this he stops, pulls over by the side of the road, looks at the trip on his app, and says.""Rockville? There is a problem. I only have 20 minutes.""  I was confused. What did he mean by this? He explained to me that he was at his max time allowed for the day, and only had 20 minutes left, and that in 20 minutes the app would shut off even if he was in the middle of a trip.  ""Oh, okay,"" I said, ""Thats fine I can get another uber.""  ""No,"" he said, ""You put the trip through the system, it pays me automatically, no problem.""  ""Oh, okay,"" I said, ""If youre happy continuing the trip Im fine with it, too. Lets go!""  ""No,"" he said, ""You dont understand. The app shut off in 20 minutes.""  ""Okay..."" I said, ""But Rockville is more than 20 minutes away, are you telling me you will only drive me until the app shuts off? If so, I should get another ride...""  ""No!"" he said, frustrated, ""My English is not good, maybe Im not explaining well. In 20 minutes the app will just shut off. I am not allowed to work more than 12 hours. See?""  He showed me something on the app.  ""I understand,"" I said, ""So you can either start driving and we can figure out the rest of the route once the app stops, or I can get out and request another ride.""  He looked down and shook his head, ""Youre not understanding me. The app will just stop in 20 minutes.""  At this point I was really confused. Ive told him he can continue the trip if he wants. Ive told him I can get another ride. And this circular conversation has gone on for several minutes.  ""Well,"" I said, ""Its late and Id like to get home so if youre not going to take me Id like you to cancel the trip so I can get another ride.""  ""No you dont understand, I can take you but my app will shut off in 20 minutes.""  I told him to cancel the trip, and that I was going to find another ride. He said he couldnt cancel it, so I said fine Ill cancel it and get a refund and got out of the car.  As I was walking away from the car, I canceled the trip, and put in a request for a new ride, which he picked up again. So I canceled it again. Then, suddenly there he was out of the car.  ""Miss, miss, I drive you no worries.""  ""No,"" I said, ""Im going to get another ride. Its no big deal. Ill find someone who has more than 20 minutes and you can spend the rest of your drive time on shorter trips.""  ""You dont understand, can I please show you on the app?""  ""Ive seen your app, but please leave me alone so I can pick up another ride.""  He kept following me down the street, telling me how I didnt understand, and he wanted to drive me but he just had 20 minutes and he was not allowed to work for more than 12 hours.  So finally I yelled ""I get it! Its late! I just want to go home Ive had a long day please leave me alone so I can pick up another ride and go home. I just want to go home.""  ""I dont want you to be mad at me. I just want to say sorry.""  ""Its fine.""  ""I dont want you to be angry.""  ""Okay, Im not angry please leave me alone.""  ""I just want to say sorry.""  ""Oh my god I accept your apology please leave me alone now!""  He finally left me alone. And I finally found a trip home.  Anyway, has anyone heard of this max time? Does anyone have any idea why be both didnt want me to leave the car, but also didnt want to take my trip?"

1,"Las Vegas Born Again Christian DriverSo Im fairly accustomed to the christian rock stations in my ubers, but my experience yesterday left me a little salty.   We picked up an uber to McCarran yesterday. To set the mood, we werent banged up or in outrageous clothing (headed out there for March Madness) or loud. Generally average, polite uber passengers. I also have a very strong sense of my spirituality. We can unpack that at another time, but to summarize, I believe if you are not harming anyone, I you can live however you want.   We were about a minute into the drive, when she goes off on her life story about being a prostitute and crack whore, then found the holy spirit in her crack pipe. Then moved out to Las Vegas to ""spread Gods Truth"". Believe me, Im all for a come back (hey Britney girl), but in true ""born-again"" fashion she went off on how we werent living our lives right because we werent living like her, since she found God. She THEN asks us if we were religious, therefore did not know if we had found God or not). I answered I was Catholic and we had just recently gotten married in the Church. LOL not good enough for her - she practically said we were heathens. Please refer to bible for approximately a bajillion verses on how you shouldnt judge people. I wonder what she would have done if I was a prostitute crack whore.  To summarize, drivers: please help me with my bags, keep your music on low, say hi and bye (im not well known for my conversations). FIVE STARS  "

1,"OverchargedSo I took an uber last night, 12 mile trip that took about 20 minutes. Before getting into the vehicle the price was 18.89. Upon exiting the vehicle at my desired location the price was the same and I tipped 4 so youd think Id be charged 22.89 right? I woke up this morning to find out that I have an outstanding charge on the trip last night and it came to FUCKING $102. There is no customer support phone service so Im wondering if anyone else had this problem and if so how do I go about it or am I just fucked?"
0,Car seat QuestionTwo out of my three rides today have been parents who come out with children about two years old and no car seat.   The first tried to lie and say it was in her boyfriends car and when I told her I couldn’t take her she went inside to get her “second car seat”. This other parent didn’t have one but there is no option to cancel and say they didn’t have a car seat. So I let the five minutes time out and selected “other” reason.  Is this what you do?   Lyft is so annoying.

He acted confused at first like he had to think about it and then asked me why I was asking.

But when I asked how he was, he answered with a real kurt, “good” and nothing else. Ok. No talking got it. I let him know that if he was hot or cold he could let me know and if he wanted a water it was right there. He just like, very slightly nodded and just looked at me. But that’s the thing, he kept looking at me. Like the entire ride home. Like he would turn his head and stare. And he was breathing heavily, which made it worse. (I am a 21 year old female, which in the area I work in seems to be real uncommon, everyone who rides says so. But I’m not attractive really, I’m chubby, 6 feet tall, super average looking. So it’s not like I’m drop dead gorgeous and he can’t get enough of me.) And then he would like kinda lean over and look down at my feet. BUT IT WAS NIGHT TIME. So it was dark. Why. Why. That was so weird. I dropped him off at a hotel, and when I drove away, I looked back and he was walking towards the road? But there was nothing else around except this hotel. So so confused. Well Todd, you were weird but thanks for the money. Also, Todd wasn’t some weird lookin dude. He was attractive and nicely dressed. Such a strange ride."

1,"VERY drunk and scary riderOn mobile yadda yadda   Last week I had a crazy dude in my car. Im female btw.  It was midweek around 7pm, I got a ping to a local bar. When I get there, i roll down the passenger window enough to confirm the pax. Instead of him immediately getting into the car, he stands outside smoking. Whatever I guess.  Hes probably in his 30s? Idk he looks like shit.  He gets in and I start his trip to find he is going to a bad part of town. Great.  Its a 20 minute drive and this guy is so friggin drunk. Hes YELLING about all this crazy shit and will not shut up. Mostly about violence and sexual things. (what I got out of it was that he is an alcoholic with a very small weiner.)  He keeps cursing, hes making no sense, he is obnoxious. I was trying to roll with it as to not anger him since he told me hes a veteran who has killed people and he clearly is not alright upstairs. He also said something along the lines of, if someone got in his face or pissed him off, he would send them to the hospital real fast.  Anyway, were pulling up to to his house and he notices 1 of my FOUR dashcam warning signs and FREAKS out yelling about how sneaky I am. (there are signs inside and outside the vehicle plus I verbally announced the camera..).   I wasnt sure if this dude was going to strangle me or stab me or what, but I was ready to pepper spray this dude.  But he didnt do any of that.  I stop the car and tell him to have a nice night.  But he wont get tf out!  He settles down again and starts rambling about some other random stupid shit so I tell him again have a great night.  The car goes completely silence for a few long creepy moments then he says ""I dont want to get anyones hopes up but can I get your number?""  I just blankly stared at him and started laughing. I could not believe what had just occoured in the last 20 mimutes  Thankfully get got out right then. I sped off going straight home and didnt uber two days after that."
0,"Done with Shared (and a question)So shared sucks. I dont like doing them, seems like quite a few drivers here also dont like them. The people that make the free will decision of willingly, knowingly, and intentionally going out of their way to open the Lyft app on their cellular device, using their fingers to punch in their destination, and of their own volition selecting the shared ride option which they are under no obligation to do so, also dont seem to like shared rides either. No one wins.  Request shared ride.  Shows up with a passenger or two in the car.  Pikachu :O face.  Every. Single. Time.  Last night was the final straw. I had decided since Monday I wasnt going to do shared rides anymore, but I do very little driving Monday-Wednesday. Yesterday I rejected every shared ride. I got a regular Lyft to a nearby town that had just hosted a sports game, so those bonuses were nice, decided to stick around. My habit right now is to enable last ride each trip and then enabling driver mode once the trip is done so no shared rides get added to my queue. Unfortunately after picking up the second person it slipped my mind and I got a shared ride added. Whatever, lets just do this.  First guy was one block away from the pin.  Second woman got on with no problem  Third guy  hails a +1. I pull up to his run down roach motel surrounded in chain link fences and barbed wire, and walks straight to my window. He is with his kid and 3 large bags telling me to cancel the ride because Im ""supposed to have room"". I offer him the trunk, he refuses. I tell him to cancel the ride and request a regular Lyft, he refuses, saying he shouldnt be the one to have to cancel his Lyft because I dont have enough room. I just no-showed his royal highness. If he has a problem with that he can contact Lyft, I have his profound and deep logic on dashcam.  That gets me to my questions, is there a more efficient way of going about this? Without straight up cancelling rides, is there a way to decline rides added to your queue? I only intend to decline shared rides. Is there a way to never even be given the request for a shared ride? My acceptance rate ha taken a nose dive but I recently learned that declines and cancellation are different so I suddenly dont care at all about acceptance rates. Losing my sanity is not worth the pocket change that shared pays."
1,"Is there a way for me to give Uber some quick extra feedback on a driver that I think deserves more than a nebulous 5 star rating?I gave the driver a 5 star and nice tip, but I kinda wanted to explain this rating and give a bit more context. Is that even possible in their system?  TL;DR: if the rating scale went to 6; this driver is the only one Ive ever had that deserves it. I just want to give the praise where its due.   The shortest version of the whole story is I ordered an uber while in line for bar bathroom and still had to close a tab; knowing this would take a few minutes, I tried to order ahead and time it right. Except whoops, turned out it was not minutes - the dude who responded was literally (not figuratively) 30 seconds down the street. When I break out quotes in a moment, know that 1: The idea behind it is more important*** because (1.1) the longer they go, the more probable its further from an exact quote,  and 2: Ill abbreviate myself as M and driver as U. Anyway, we went down the standard quick message exchange of:  U: ""Im here""   M: ""Be right there"" ... ""Closing tab. Ill be like 3 minutes."" (I probably kept the dude waiting at least 5 minutes, maybe a tad longer. Honestly, Id have canceled on me if I were him).   Spoiler if you ignore parenthesis: I took longer than that by a bit...and then some. He messaged again and then called me; my phone rang pretty much the moment I walked out of the bar and the driver immediately saw me and gave a light beep. He was right in front of the bar I was at, just directly across the street. I hopped in and he goes, ""I was looking around and literally no one is on this street. You walked out of the bar and immediately were trying to answer your phone so I assumed you were my rider so I stopped the call and just beeped cause its easier"". I said, ""Thanks you made finding you really easy. My bad, that I took a bit longer than I expected."" He said no worries, ""Despite the long weekend, its been a slow night. Neither of us seem to be in any hurry."" (this is sunday, I left the Pats game in the third quarter I think?)  So now Im in the car and he goes on:  U: ""Even if this was a Saturday night at the busiest hour, since you messaged me saying you were coming, just for that, Id wait a few extra minutes beyond the usual 5. I dont want to leave a rider who was responsive hanging, even if it means I have to keep waiting a few minutes while you find me.""  M: ""Well thats nice. Thanks for that benefit of the doubt, I hope I didnt push that very far.""  U: ""Its okay, you definitely didnt. Im used to people, especially those that dont send some sort of message, doing that though and me then having to cancel. It happens all the time, even for people that try to be responsive, but I honestly dont mind if they ghost me. I know the easy excuses for them are that DC streets can get busy, people get drunk, or its hard to find each other and ya know? But its really just not a huge deal. I know those are the easy excuses, but in my mind I hope at least the people that are responsive then ghost me do so because they found a better option for theri night.""  M: ""Uh... wait Im not sure I get what do you mean?""  U: ""A better option. Anything. Maybe even a cheaper cab, I dont care - I would do the same! But I really hope that the better option is something like, on their way out, they ran into an old friend and wanted to reconnect; or they met someone they really hit it off with, romantically speaking - and these are now more important than getting in my uber.   I know these things are rare, but theyre not unheard of...I just really hope that that type of thing is a bit unheard of to me because thats what my rider is doing when they dodge me. Or just in general that they found anything that they find more important than spending 15 minutes in the back seat of my car.""   M: "". . . .  Ww  . .  . . Damn, thats one of the nicest things Ive ever heard anyone say""  U: ""Thank you for saying that""   His thoughts and this brief back and forth left an impression on me. And now that its after the fact, it *really* clicked in my head that I almost fell into that group of MIA riders to the point I nearly felt guilty by not actually being one of them and sitting in the back of his uber, but really sitting in the back of his uber for 15 or so minutes and also mostly just for hearing his train of thought on the uber rider ghosting driver issue, it was absolutely worth it.   The rest was good, unrelated convo from there. I gave the driver an instant 5 stars and added a nice tip on. Ive done all that before of course, but I really felt compelled to call out this uber drivers sincere kindness somewhere. If theres a better option for extra positive feedback for an uber drvier than this, let me know.      &amp;nbsp;   That kinda wasnt very short...sorry."

So I emailed support and they got us in touch.   When I was on the phone with the driver, I offered him $50 cash to drive it all the way back to me and he accepted.   Now lyft is emailing me asking all kinds of questions, specifically asking if he returned it to me or if I picked it up.  I don’t want him to get in trouble for accepting a cash offer as oppose to the $15 fee that’s normally charged.

0,"Ride Challenge Bonus?Man, I’m the biggest advocate for Lyft.  I exclusively drive for Lyft, not both Lyft and Uber for one reason.  Because at the end of the day, I felt Lyft really cared for both Driver and Passenger.  So last week, I completed 107 rides.  The ride challenge bonus is 108 rides for me.  I spoke with driver support and was guaranteed to receive the bonus for several reasons, but most notably the first ride request I received on Sunday cancelled because it took me longer to get to the passenger the estimated. The exit I was supposed to take was closed, so I was forced to go to the next exit. By the time I got turned around, the ride was cancelled.    I also sat in the airport que for way to long on Monday morning becasue I received a text from Lyft saying to leave the staging area and that I would get a Lyft request on the way.  So here I am almost a week later after being guaranteed a bonus of $164.00 for 107 rides and Lyft is just screwing me.  Billions invested into this company, with more promised on the way because of the drivers and here Lyft is just screwing me over.  For $164.00  🖕🏼Lyft   2-10-19 Retraction  Lyft finally issued me the bonus.  Let it be known, I had less then the required rides to technically receive the bonus.

I open my app next day and it doesnt work - a message appears saying too many cancellations (I didnt make any cancellations). I report it to uber. They ask for a screenshot (?) so I send one of the login screen with a message showing your account has been deactivated) 10. Several days later, uber is still deactivated and Im not getting any response from uber customer support. 11. I delete uber and uber eats from my phone 12. Ive been a VIP rider for about a year and use uber at least 4 times a week.    Now tell me... what the F should one do in a situation like this? How can I proceed with my case at the cops if I cant access my uber acct because Im locked out? If I cant get the driver details from Uber, how can I report him? Why have I been locked out and not told whats going on? How can I find out if my old device is involved?    It might be some scammer unrelated to the driver, but I cant go fetch the phone from this potentially dangerous guy, without taking along my own potentially dangerous guys, and having it escalate rapidly, without knowing.    It seems like really shit support from Uber."
1,"Friends got me kicked off UberDoes anyone know how to get in touch with Uber support outside of their app?   I ordered a ride for some friends last weekend that were intoxicated and got an email after their ride saying my account is on hold pending a report from a recent trip. I haven’t taken any other Uber rides in a few weeks, so I know it was them but they don’t remember anything out of the ordinary happening on the ride.  I can’t log into the app (it’s disabled) and haven’t gotten a reply back when responding to Uber’s email. Obviously this is a good lesson learned to never order a ride for someone again. I just want to try and get this cleared up but cant figure out how to get in touch with Uber."

0,"Where can I find the Lyft app for iOS9?Yeah, I know: The answer is get a new phone or dont use Apple or whatever. But thats not gonna fix the problem.  My Dad is old and can no longer drive so, irrespective of budget concerns (which are myriad), he knows his old iPhone 4S and is comfortable with it. Nonetheless, he needs a way to get around town from time to time. Obvious answer: Lyft, right? Except for the fact that I cannot find anywhere to download the old version of the Lyft App that will still work on his iOS9 phone. Lyft states that the old version will still work [for passengers](https://help.lyft.com/hc/en-us/articles/115013080508-Phone-software-recommendations-and-settings)  (minus some features which he can probably live without), so he should be good to go. If I can help him install that old app.  Help, please!  Thanks.  P.S. Does Lyft even have anywhere on their support site where one can submit a request that doesnt fit one of their limited choices? Is that any way to talk to or email a real human support person at Lyft?"

1,"Seeking advice on how to get customer service traction on consistently repeated fares being higher than the estimate.First, I travel a lot for work. Too much.  And around 2013 I discovered Uber.  Easily the greatest positive impact on my business travels (and ultimately personal travels) since TSA precheck (actually, can’t remember which came first). Needless to say, I’m a huge fan and for the most part, am very loyal to Uber.   I was elated last fall when they began offer a rewards program.  However at that time something else happened.  For a reason I cannot currently explain... since November 2018 (ish), every single ride I take TO (not from) Denver International Airport - from my home - is $2-5 higher upon invoice than when estimated.     I’ve had the airport address listed as “work” for years now and haven’t changed a thing.  But now all the sudden every single ride comes back charging me $2-5 more than the estimate.  Proportionally more if surging.    Is my work paying for this?  Yes.  Is the $2-5 a huge deal?  No really.  But it REALLY irks me that this happens so consistently and even more concerning is how Uber is now responding to this issue.    I’ve been contacting Uber support on this since November and initially, they would quickly respond with essentially, ”We’re sorry.  Here is a credit for the difference.”  No mention of, you’re doing it wrong or, this is why this is happening.  Ok, mistakes happen.  But they’re making it right.  I can appreciate that.   Then recently, the responses changed.  Now they respond by saying, “We’ve issued you too many credits and will no longer do so.”     Now wait a minute...   1) If I’m, doing something wrong... tell me what it is and I’ll correct it.  No credit needed.  My fault.  But guide me on what my malfunction is.   OR...  2) If Uber is doing something wrong.... over and over and over again... why is there a “limit” for how many times they are willing to make good on the resolution?  I mean why should I be “cut off” from getting a justified credit if they haven’t fixed the issue causing it?  This is more of a principal thing to me.  As loyal as I’ve been to Uber, I feel slighted every time they “overcharge” me and especially now they’ve basically said, “stop asking us to fix this.”  Thanks in advance to anyone that might offer some guidance or direction in resolving this (or just enlightening me).   TD;LR - Uber is consistently charging me more than the estimate for to-airport trips. "
1,"Freebird..do they charge a premium?Are the prices on Freebird more expensive than if you book directly with Uber or Lyft for anybody else or just me?     For example, I set the same destination in Freebird and Uber with the same initial pickup/dropoff location. With Freebird, the estimate was $5.50, with the Uber app, $3.55 (I normalized estimates using the subtotal, sans discounts, since both fares should have technically been $0.00). Does this imply that Freebird is tacking on an additional charge/fee? The premium for booking through the Freebird app is 54.93% (($5.50-$3.55)/$3.55) more expensive than if I had just booked with Uber directly!

I was planning on driving full time (already did the math and found out how to make it work). It’d be nice to be able to drive in both areas, but I know California requires a license and registration from there specifically, and based on what I’ve found, it looks like Arizona does not.  So, my question is: if I got a drivers license in Los Angeles and registered my car in California, would I be able to primarily drive in the Phoenix area, and still be able to drive when I’m in LA?  Tl;dr: Asking if it’s possible to be a Lyft driver in Arizona and California at the same time."
0,"At what point do I call Lyft about a driverHello all,  Ive been using Lyft pretty regularly and have generally had great experiences.  Today Im on my way to the airport. Before ordering my ride I placed all my luggage at my curb, and waited outside until my driver was there so they didnt have to wait for me.  First thing was the driver stopped four houses short of my house (and where I placed the pickup marker). I had to wave him down frantically before my timer ran out. Then as we were getting on the highway at the North/south split (while I was looking at my flight info on my phone) he went the wrong way. Completely against the phone directions. We went 15 min out of our way to turn around but he added another 15 by missing more directions. After the third set of missed directions (I was giving him the benefit of the doubt, some directions were like cut across five Lanes of traffic right now) I started to tell him where to go. This caused him to brake compeltely on the on ramp to the highway to listen to me. He nearly took the wrong directions every time but Im now 30 min behind on my original trip which was supposed to take 33 min. So now its over an hour to get to the airport.   Is this something I should contact Lyft about? In the future should I speak up sooner?"
1,"Ride Availability in Bend, OR + Surrounding RegionWhat is the experience like in the Bend, OR region using Uber as a passenger? Im curious if there are a lot of drivers (frequent ride availability) or if it is difficult to get picked up.   Im going to Bend in July and was considering staying outside of town, like in Tumalo, to save on AirBnB costs, but if it is a challenge to get picked up there or get a ride back to Tumalo, we will probably just get a place within the Bend city limits.  Thank you for your help in advance.      "
1,"Sharing payment account...So I had my payment information stolen and used only on Uber, 2 times it went through and the third time was blocked. Got in contact with support and got a refund but they said something that struck me as odd, they said “thank you for confirming you didn’t share your payment account with anyone else.” This situation could have been avoided if they had a system that asked for confirmation before someone else uses that payment option. Instead I had the money taken out of my bank account and I assume that whoever used my card was able to get a free ride because of that. I’m not upset about this because I’ve gotten my money back and just have to hope my bank card info wasn’t stolen and used again, but this could be costing Uber drivers money and that isn’t good at all.

1,"Uber took $300 gift card then banned my account.   TLDR: We win a $300 gift card for Uber Eats, try to use it with a new account and Uber immediately bans us for fraud, refuses to tell us why and has basically stolen $300 from us.  Full story: So, my father in law won a tailgate party pack from an online contest offered being held by Highland Park Whiskey: [http://goout365.com/highlandparktailgate](http://goout365.com/highlandparktailgate)  That contest in particular. Its pretty cool, we got Highland Park stuff and a $300 gift card for Uber Eats. Downside is we get it in the mail the day after the Superbowl, but whatever we can still get food! My FiL has never used Uber and isnt a big tech guy, so we set up a new Uber account and activate the gift card for him.  The gift card works, we have a $300 credit in the app showing. We add a credit card and verify the email. Then we try to place our order. Heres where things get funky- the app lets us go all the way to the end of the order process and then says the order is invalid. So I restart the app, thinking maybe something just went wrong. As soon as I go to log back in, the app tells me that the account is disabled. WTF? It also gives me a link to request re-activation.  I follow the link and submit the info, and within like 20 minutes I get a reply saying the account was accidentally flagged for fraud but its back up. Okay, cool. I am able to log back in, so I do the whole order over, and try to place it. Same error code. Account disabled.  I send ANOTHER email. Get another response, says the same thing. Accidental flag. Try again. Can log in, try order, order invalid. Submit another email. No response now.  So this all happened last night. This morning we get an email from Uber that says that our account has been suspended and will not be re-activated. So were out $300, and apparently theres no support number I can call to try to get this figured out.  So thanks Uber, hope you enjoy that $300. For anyone else, I would strongly recommend against trying to use giftcard on a new account, no matter how well verified the account is.    \-also posted this to UberEats, but this subreddit may be better? This is so frustrating."

I ended up having to scramble and call a Taxi and by this point I’ll be lucky if I make my flight.  I know this is an on demand service but god damn when it’s mostly reliable it does trick you into thinking it’s 100%.    Why doesn’t Lyft have a feature where I, as the passenger, can offer more money to the driver or pre tip so the driver knows to expect more cash. I’d rather up the fare another $20-30 just to have someone accept!  I’m sure the drivers don’t want to make the long trek to the airport without a potential return fare but for fucks sake this is annoying.

Well as I begin signing in it tells me ""something went wrong. Try again later"". I think nothing of it and leave it be. Since I dont live in a city that is supported by Uber who cares, right?    Fast forward to a few days ago, I am now working in a city that has Uber and Uber Eats. So I download Uber Eats and try to sign in. Cant sign in.. Email is already in use. Well DUH its my Uber email address as well..    So then I contact support to assist me with changing the number on my account and getting my email allowed for Uber Eats.

1,"Uber app has a ""feature"" that is breaking the experience for riders and drivers where I live.So, this is a totally trivial detail, one would think, but I had no luck trying to get in touch with Uber, so ill leave this here.  Im in the Dominican Republic. Uber is great here. Until recently, its been cash only.... But now you can pay with your defined payment method.... Great, right?  So I thought.... After taking some rides recently, I noticed that it was harder to get picked up, with phantom drivers displayed that never moved, drove mysteriously around the block, and just generally took longer to show up.  I noticed the drivers I had seemed a little miffed when I talked to them about Uber using cards now.... I quickly gathered that card customers tip much more poorly.  To me, this was confusing, because I assumed the opposite would be true, based on my limited experience.  The drivers I rode and talked with with were professional, courteous, friendly, and patient with my poor Spanish....I couldnt figure out why they werent getting tipped.   So, pondering this, I got out of my last ride, determined to leave a tip of at least 30 percent of my ride.... And I accidently left a tip of 0.3 percent instead.   You see, the UI assumes that currencies here work like in the USA. They dont. There are no fractional pesos. A peso is worth about 0.02usd. So when I typed in ""50"" for my tip, it left 0.50 pesos, an amount less than the smallest legal denomination by half.   Now, people here are used to dealing in whole pesos. No one uses fractional pesos, and it wont occur to anyone to type 5000 when they want to leave a 50 peso tip.... and it doesnt help that in the app font, the decimal is a tiny dot lol.   Now, with the mystery ""solved"", I asked around, and sure enough many drivers had received microscopic tips, but had no idea why. They just assumed that people paying by card tended to be comically cheap. Talking more, most had heard of some drivers pretending not to be able to find card paying riders, in order to pick up the cancelation fee.... Keeping themselves free to pick up cash riders. Im not sure how they can tell the difference? Does that show up in their dashboard? It must.   Uber should fix this ASAP. Its hurting drivers, and that is hurting riders.   So.... App developers working in a global market.... If your market doesnt use fractional currency on the street, be sure to get fractional currency out of your UI."

So i drive to that spot and wait out the 5 minutes and try to call the pax. Both times the call went to voice mail and when the five minutes are up i click no show and move along. The app will then tell me i get my $5 cancellation fee but by the next morning it is removed.    The first time i let it slide but the second time i went in the app and put two help tickets in for both of them and i just got my response from lyft where they are telling me that i was too far from the pax pickup location to mark it as a no show.     So what am i supposed to do the next time to ensure that i get this $5 if the pax wont answer their phone to tell me where they are?

1,"Back and forth over payment issueHi all, apologies as this is kind of to vent. Last week I took a ride and my Uber cash balance was too low to cover it, and apparently when I reloaded it, it didn’t go through. I was still able to take the ride, and didn’t know until later that day when I tried to ride home but was told I had an outstanding balance.   I tried to pay with 3 totally separate credit cards, PayPal and Apple Pay but nothing worked  I contacted uber and they told me My account was locked due to the balance and asked for the card to pay it down. I obliged three times but it didn’t work, and they didn’t understand the problem. Finally I got someone higher up who saw the issue was with Uber and sent it to a different team. I was very frustrated but glad someone was working on it.   Flash forward to yesterday and I had no update after 6 days. I messaged then in the app again and a member of the Account Escalation Team replies saying they were sorry, the issue has been seen by others, and they had waved the balance and then closed the ticket.   I tried to test this but was greeted with them same error as before. I logged another request but the person sent me back to square one asking for the credit card. I told them this wasn’t helping and asked for escalation again. I then contacted Uber support on twitter and they said they would look in to it. I was then informed by the team in the new rocket they couldn’t pay the balance, and they closed the ticket again without helping at all. In Twitter they said the same.   I’ve now tweeted at Uber itself and logged a new request but I am at my wits end. Seemingly I cant get any consistency, and have been apparently lied to by their ‘highest customer support team’ about the balance being cleared. My account is still unusable and the help team is dogshit who don’t listen to me or understand my problem and I’m worried I wont be able to get a proper response again. I even sent pictures of the Escalation Team messages but to no avail  Is there any other recourse I have? I don’t trust Uber at all now and just want this resolved but don’t expect I can get ahold of anyone.   Sorry for any spelling, cause, Mobile   Edit for TL;DR: Uber is dicking me around, and I can’t get help to fix it. "

My question is, is there some kind of data leak or weakness in the app that he would be able to use, to not only know who ordered the Lyft, but also the name of the driver? "

I took the pictures, got the reimbursement this morning. Since she was my last ride she also decided to give me a 1 star rating. This brings me from a 4.9 to a 4.85. Honestly, I do care about my rating more than actually being an uber driver if that makes any sense. Is there any way to dispute this as a sort of act of retribution given the $150 charge?"

0,"Lyft SCAM **MUST READ**I stated below on March 3rd 2019 and I finally heard back from Lyft after contacting them via Twitter and via email. It took 4 days to hear back from them.  Scroll down.  ""On March 3, 2019 I only drove 1 passenger. I picked up a passenger named E at 3:04PM from Fredericksburg. E requested to go from Fredericksburg to Culpeper and from Culpeper to Baltimore,MD and from Baltimore, MD to Fredericksburg, VA. The distance from Fredericksburg to Culpeper was 30miles. And the distance From Culpeper to Baltimore, MD was 113miles. And the distance from Baltimore, MD to Fredericksburg, VA was 103miles. Total of 246miles. I drove total distance of 246miles for 6hrs 19min 52seconds. Please see the attachment. After I dropped off the passenger,E, I only received $86.38. I should have received at least $250 for the total miles I driven and for the waiting time at the gas station in Culpeper, VA and at the house in Warrenton,VA. I waited at least more than 20min at each stop.""  This is what I received from Lyft March 8th 2019:  ""Thank you for being in contact with Lyft support, In regards to Es ride. Im happy to assist you today.  I understand how important are your earnings for you thats why I was checking this ride step by step and  I can see that your earnings were correct based on the time and distance rates for this ride’s region. Let me clarify some points in this kind of situations, each driver is allowed to complete a ride with no more than 100 miles, when a ride has more than 100 miles the app does not recalculate the ride correctly because it got the maximum of miles. In the future, I suggest you take care of it.  I attached you the information about how was recalculated the ride. I hope this information can help you a lot.  Earnings$86.38 Time Cost ($0.2250/minute x 379.85 minutes)$85.47 Base Charge$0.91 Total Fare$86.38   You can view the rate card and breakdown of this ride in the Driver History tab of your Driver Dashboard.  If you have anything else that I can help you with, Just let me know, I will be happy to assist you.  Regards,  Lyft.""  So, they are NOT compensating. They blame on drivers. If app does not recalculate directly, then it is Lyfts fault. How can they blame on drivers? and i did not even know about no more than 100 miles BS. This is so wrong. Plus Lyft admits that "" your earnings were correct based on the time and distance rates for this ride’s region.""-Yes, I drove 246miles and you fucking know it. I should gotten paid at least $250.  I know someone had a similar situation and got their money back and now i am here and getting ripped off. This is so fucked up.

""   Update 3/9/19 10:30AM.   This morning I drove to a Lyft hub in Alexandria,VA. I told an agent in a hub what happened and she told me that she talked to someone in San Francisco and someone from San Francisco who is higher up will take a review and send me an email later today. From a hub, they were able to check my miles and time. They are aware of the fact that I did not get paid for miles. They even know I should have gotten paid for the miles.

I am still waiting for their emails. Tweeter from @AskLyft sent me messages that someone from Lyft Support Team will send me an email with an update. However, no one has sent me any messages or email. I have sent them multiple emails and they have not replied back yet. It is more than a week. To be exact--9 days since i submitted a report. I do not know who the managers or supervisors are, but they need to take a review as soon as possible and send me compensation. This is sooooo frustrating. Does anyone know the telephone number to call? cause im exhausted.  Update: 3/13/19 8:13AM. https://i.imgur.com/qVBHuVn.png  I received an email from Lyft and received compensation of $213.62 for miles. It took exactly 9 days to get it back after sending numerous emails, sending multiple messages to @AskLyft via Tweeter, talking to Lyft employees at Lyft hub, calling Lyft,etc. I want to say thank you to those who supported me and helped me with providing valuable informations. Thank you!!! I hope Lyft is more transparent with their policy and with driver agreement. A 100 mile cap is BS and NOT stated in the driver agreement. Lastly, I am willing to help any drivers who is going through this. Please send me messages. I am here for you.  "

Well upon receiving said phone, not only was it turned off (suspicious since it was at 92% since I charged it fully before heading to work), but there was also a white sticker that had like a QR code or barcode on it. Does this sticker mean anything because my driver didnt mention it at all and I was already on high alert as it was turned off when returned and the driver did not return any of my and Ubers messages for 5 days even though I reached out 5 minutes after getting out of the Uber? Although it might be (mean) nothing, I just want to know why it was even on the phone in the first place. "

I guess I live in a pretty populated area in Florida, so hopefully the driver situation isn’t overinflated.

0,"Is Lyft Personal Power Zone a scam? Email I sent to LyftLink to screenshot of what it looks like [Lyft personal power zone](https://imgur.com/a/zlgopRD)  Is there any way you can revert me back to the old Prime time surge pricing? Personal power zone is a scam and barely pays anything. It’s almost as if the intent was to eliminate surges altogether or at the least reduce the amount significantly. I have a really hard time believe real, experienced (18 months+), high earning, full time drivers are actually earning more with PPZ in a non-heavily controlled environment.   Among the problems I have with it is, it artificially offers lower surge amounts than Prime Time. With Prime time I know where demand is (that was never an issue, so I’m confused why the app is praising itself for fixing something that wasn’t broken), I knew what the multiplier could be 100-500%, and I had more control in being able to decline trash requests with 25% surge in favor of requests with say 200% or more.   With Personal Power Zone, despite the app knowing what the maximum it is willing to offer you is, it doesn’t disclose that to the driver. That’s like saying go to this area because I’ll pay you more but I won’t tell you how much more, just trust me..... The app makes you wait for the power zone bonus to increase by 1-4 cents which is quite honestly a bit insulting. Why make us wait? Why not give us the max upfront? Then it locks us in the location as in we can’t leave the location or else we lose that specific bonus amount unlike with Uber. Although the app can send us requests of riders outside the zone without a bonus while we’re in it which makes absolutely no sense and defeats the entire purpose. I think it’s wrong to not apply the bonus to each individual pool passenger. Uber does.   Since the change, my earnings have been in freefall. I generally shoot for $200-250 a day after Lyft commission fees, now I’m lucky to hit $150, and that’s because the surge is being artificially tampered with, I suspect. Comparing screenshots from this and last year, there is a huge surge difference. This Year has way less surge while last year there would be a 300-500% almost every morning. Especially when it rained or snowed unlike earlier this week when the were no surges for the majority of the day.    If you guys are going to try to copy Uber’s feature at least try to improve upon it, instead of going backwards. What you should have done was copy Uber’s pass through rates, meaning if I driver through a surge region, I retain the rate not matter if I stay in the location or not, as long as I’m online. You should also not set the surge to a fixed dollar amount, instead opting for a percentage/multiplier. Fixed dollar surges are ONLY good for short rides, the longer and out of the way the ride is, the more the driver loses in terms of opportunity cost. Percentage/multiplier surges are good when the ride is long distance but the surge, short distance rides are only attractive if the surge is high enough, say 500%.       "
0,"Express drive program. Don’t understand the rulesI picked up a car on Friday last week.Lyft charged me or will charge rent payment for the remaining days in last week. It’s going to be something like 120 or whatever. So today is new week. And I see in my account that I have to pay for rent x dollars (this amount is for the whole week) and I have to make 20 rides minimum (which is minimum for whole week from Monday to Monday) , but I also see that I have to return a car on Friday this week. So it means that I will work only 5 days in this week. But why Do I have to pay rent payment for the whole week?   Let’s imagine that I made 20 rides which is required. And then I am able to renew lease. But does it mean that if I renew , I’ll have to return a car still on Friday but in the next week?  Am I able to renew a lease and return a car on Monday? In this case I will pay only this “ x”dollar which is for the whole week? "
0,"Would “please don’t smoke in your car” be an unpopular thing to say?I had to get a Lyft ride home the other night and I noticed that the car had a faint cigarette smell. It wasn’t *that* big a deal in the moment because it was faint, but when I went to grab my jacket this morning, I found that it smelled like cigarettes. As I don’t smoke, I don’t really appreciate having to go around smelling like I just finished smoking a few.   If it would be too much to ask drivers to not smoke inside their cars, I’d at least hope Lyft could modify the app so the passenger/driver matching process takes into account whether or not the driver smokes.  Edit: I should have said this at first but I did mention the smell in the comments section when I paid and rated.   Edit 2: Everyone, I messed up. It’s only hitting me now that from my wording it looks like I’m asking whether I could get away with directly telling people not to smoke in their cars. That’s not what I’m trying to ask at all. What I mean to ask is, would saying I wish people didn’t smoke in their cars be an unpopular thing to say *here,* in a social media/forum setting.   I *did* leave a comment in the rating saying the car faintly smelled like cigarettes smoke, and that’s it. Didn’t badger the driver or try to “chase it up the chain of command” or anything.   I was wondering why people were talking like I was saying I wanted to tell people to their faces not to smoke in their cars, only to realize....I basically did say that by not wording my initial question properly.  I hope this makes sense."

0,"Passenger Pick-UPs = TicketsHey all!! Been driving for Lyft off and on for the past two years. Lately Ive been getting tickets for picking up Pax in unauthorized zones. I drive in the Bay Area, CA. Most tickets have come from SanFrancisco. Believe me, I attempt to avoid picking up anyone in an unsafe or unauthorized zone. Thing is Sanfrancisco is changing zones, streets, signs and rules faster than anyone can keep up.  Itd be nice of Lyft could send something out to passengers requesting that they be in a safe and authorized place for pick-up. These tickets are ridiculous to say the least. Made up my mind that the best thing for me is to stop somewhere safe and call them to walk to where I am or just cancel the ride altogether. You wont even see the persons ticketing you. Heck considering all the signs and curbs you have to read... its just a loosing battle. Citys in the Bay Area have found an abundant source of revenue. Wont be much longer before I hang it up. Poor pay and now tickets  for areas mostly only the issuers are aware of. And yeh... I know what a bus stop looks like. Also construction zones. Thats the obvious.  For as much money as I pay Lyft they should help drivers by being aware and communicating changes. Also informing passengers to be aware of where they are expecting to be picked up. Would it be so hard to have a department that drives around and notes changes and areas and add them to the map as a no go zone?"

I recently booked a pool ride from my Bronx location to a point in lower Manhattan and opted to pay $12 extra not to have to walk.  I was picked up at my location, but was let out at a drop off point near my destination.  One, I feel I was cheated.  Two, I use a walker to get around - its not just laziness that I dont want to walk to a pickup/drop off point.   Ordering a ride back home I wasnt even given the option to be picked up where I was, i.e. There was only an express option.    Did I miss some announcement about limited pool options in Manhattan?     Should I try to get a partial refund on the $12 up charge because it only applied to one side of the ride?

This is rich.  EDIT  I just spoke with Lyft. A few updates from the post linked above:  1. The driver (Melinda, bless her heart) actually ADMITTED to what I said happened. Her defense: ""They were white (meaning my wife and I), what does it matter?"" This is what justified Lyfts ""permanent deactivation"" of her. 2. AFTER I filed my report with Lyft and she was notified, she THEN filed a claim against me claiming I carved ""F U"" into the passenger side door of the vehicle. Melinda then must have carved it into her door herself so that she could take pictures and provide it to Lyft. 3. Lyft protocols dictate deactivating my account (which i understand) during their investigation. He also advised if found liable, they can deduct up to $250 from my account for the damage.  4. He acknowledged that he sees the writing on the wall for what this is and hopes to have this rectified shortly, although he does not make the decisions.  5. I reminded him that, at the end of the day, if this needs to be elevated, our trip ended at the airport where there are hundreds of cameras everywhere. We can see what was done."

I arrive there, and find out the ride destination is actually 3-4 miles in the complete OPPOSITE direction from the direction of my school. That’s the second time in a week it’s done that, I shouldn’t be getting those rides in destination modes.   It’s probably cuz I was the only driver near but still annoying because I had to drive 2 miles only to find out they were heading in the OPPOSITE direction of my set destination mode. This morning I just cancelled the ride as I was outside their house and turned off the Lyft app entirely as apparently destination mode can’t even be trusted anymore. Wtf Lyft?

It was my last ten so I planned to tip in the app but good thing I didn’t.  He reported that my trip ended a good 7-8 miles away and so my trip went from $26 to $38.  Needless to say Uber support credit me “.58” when I brought up the issue and I’m fighting for the additional $12 off.  Almost ten years of using Uber and I’ve never come across a shady driver like this. I’ve had one try and pull a cleaning fee on me and that got dismissed but yeah,  Check your receipts vs your trip summary vs your credit card and make sure everything aligns.  Now I understand why this girl (back when I worked as a banker) would come every two weeks trying to dispute an extra $5 or $4 on her card and not knowing where it came from because it didn’t reconcile with her Uber trip summary..."

I drive a lot for work, so I need something that is reliable, low mileage, etc. I’m thinking about splurging a bit because of this, and a friend said to consider driving Uber nights and weekends to make payments on the car easier. Is this an actual likelihood? How much do people make on Uber driving maybe 4 hours every week night and then maybe 10 hours every weekend?

1,"Damn it Uber pay these quest boosts you offerSeems every morning I get a Quest offer. Usually $3 for next ride given between x:xx AM and x:xx ( 1 hour time frame ). If I fall for this and take the next qualifying offer, the payout is not in the fare. After concluding my rides for the day I contact Uber telephone support and report. I find it necessary to jump through hoops to be credited. Same thing this morning when I completed 2 consecutive rides with $3 bonus. Contact support and 5 minutes later I am told it has been rectified. Still nothing in my earnings 2 hours later. When I questioned support why this problem occurs every single time It was suggested I wipe the app and reinstall. I call BS before I do this. Anyone else experiencing this problem?"

1,"It took me 2.5 hours to get somewhere 20 minutes away, and the driver bitched to both me and another passenger by insisting we ""need to learn to use the app""Sorry for the length. TL;DR at bottom.    I had to get somewhere that was a 20-minute highway drive away. I go there a lot and always take Uber Pool, and also try to leave -1hr early in case other people get added to the trip. So 1hr before my appointment today, I requested a ride and was paired with Driver 1. But Driver 1 never drove towards me, and just sat in a gas station parking lot down the street for 27 minutes. I cancelled. Then I had to re-request, but by that time rush hour had hit and the price tripled. Now, because of that, I had to stick with Pool because the UberX price had become preposterous. Great.  Then I got paired with Driver 2 (a different person), and that person was also sitting in the SAME gas station parking lot for an extended period of time without driving towards me. Then Driver 2 cancelled. Then I got paired with Driver 3, who was over 20 minutes away from my location and already driving in the opposite direction on the highway. So Driver 3 understandably cancelled. Then I got paired with Driver 4 who picked me up.   But Driver 4 was an asshole.   I live in a city that can sometimes be confusing. So I had walked to a nearby building that wasnt busy and easier for a driver to both find and park in front of. But my driver still passed it 3 times. Okay I understand that mistakes happen. However. Where I was located is easy to find, I was the only one standing there, I had talked to her on the phone and described exactly where I was standing and what I was wearing, and I waved as she passed every time. She made eye contact with me every time. The third time I even stood in the street off to the side, so I could step forward a little bit as she approached, but she saw me and then pulled around me and drove past.   On the 4th time around, Driver 4 picked me up, but before I even said hello or had my seatbelt buckled, she was complaining about my pick up spot and blaming me because one of the roads she had to drive down on the way there was missing a street sign (like thats my fucking fault). She wasnt yelling, but she was being curt and talking down to me. I didnt respond to her. I just sat there silently.   Then we went to pick up the next PAX, and that PAX did the same thing I did. She lives somewhere that is hard to pull into, so she walked to a nearby restaurant and requested there in an effort to make a drivers job easier. We pulled into the restaurant parking lot, and you could see the PAX clearly standing there (looking down at her phone then up directly at the car, the only person outside, waving the car over, has a face that matches the profile picture). But Driver 4 still proceeded to drive in circles around this small parking lot, passing her over 6 times. Im not sure what was going on in her head, because that person was clearly who she was supposed to pick up. Driver 4 was also staring at her phone without looking up at the road at all, and driving past exactly where the app was telling her to stop.  Did her brain just flatline for a few minutes? Does she not have enough experience? Was she overwhelmed by driving in the city? Was something wrong that made her act so weird? I dont know. It was strange.    On the 7th time around, she picked up the other PAX. Then, just like she did to me, nastily complained about the pickup location being difficult (it wasnt). This PAX calmly defended herself, saying that she had actually walked to a place that was easier for an Uber driver to find and she was trying to wave her over the whole time. But the driver just cut her off dismissively, made an irritated noise, then ignored the PAX entirely.   We were all riding in awkward silence for a while, then out of nowhere Driver 4 loudly exclaimed that ""people like you all need to learn to use the app before you use it."" Neither of us bothered responding.   When all was said and done and I arrived at my location, 2.5 hours had passed since I tried to request my first ride. It was far more expensive than I anticipated. Also keep in mind that I had walked to another building to request, so I was just standing in front of a random hotel for most of that time. Its cold outside.   I checked Driver 4s rating, and it was 4.59. I wonder why.   TL;DR Got a series of drivers who werent driving towards me or canceled, then was eventually paired with a driver who was acting weird and bitched at me and another PAX.   Edit: Typo in rating number. Adding a missing ""and"" to a sentence.  "

Between this subreddit, some Facebook groups, and friends and family, I am always hearing about horror stories from bad drivers ranging from dangerous driving, to rude demeanors, and worse.  Many of our markets are over saturated with drivers, making the competition harder to compete with everyday.  It is no fair for the good drivers to have to compete with these kinds of drivers.

1,"Gotta go back to Ubereats because my insurance doesnt allow rideshare.If I get in accident they will ban my Geico policy and other insurance may see that fact and it can affect me in future.  In my state all the insurance companies that offer rideshare wont take me due to lapse of insurance coverage, so until I stay at least 6 months with Geico I cant even go to rideshare insurance companies.  The beauty of UberEats is I dont need any decal or anything and unless I run over the person ordering the food, no one will know accident resulted during food delivery for Uber.

I woke up Sunday morning and found that my 2012 Acura MDX was stolen out of my parking garage right below my apartment...obviously that sucks.   Anyways, I wanted to contact Lyft to inform them because there are Lyft stickers affixed to the vehicle. I have no idea what nefarious activities this thief has planned for using the stolen vehicle but I wanted to let them know somehow that I no longer have possession of the vehicle. First, is this even necessary? I know they can’t impersonate me necessarily, but my car could be implicated in someway and fall back on me somehow, if it were used to commit a crime. Second, is there anyway to contact an actual person? I have tried to submit the information to Lyft and about the only way I can see to get the info to them is filing through the service animal complaint form. What the hell?"

My creditor charged back these charges, due to suspected fraud, and uber has since locked me out of my account. Now my account is being held until I pay what they are owed for the ride(s).  When dealing with the support team, I’m only able to get email support and it’s from a different member of the team with every single response. Since I can’t check my account (due to it being locked) I am just being spun around by the support team asked the exact same questions by a new person each time.  I’m getting frustrated and just want to ensure I’m not paying for fraudulent activity, but will happily pay for rides I’ve taken.

Thoughts?When I pulled up for a ride for a woman, she texted me saying it was going to be for her husband who was trying to fill up a gas can for a scooter. I figure, okay. Scooters are small vehicles, maybe were talking a Walmart shelf-sized little container of gas. So I proceed to the pickup location, and a man comes out of the garage carrying a 3-4 gallon gas container and asks me if I’d like it in the trunk. In my head I’m like Hell No. So I had to break it to him and his son that there’s no way I can transport that for them, like what is this. If that thing spills in my car, I’m screwed. Best case scenario my car smells like gas for the rest of the day and I just made like $4 on that ride. So I happily cancelled the ride. What would you guys have done? Would you have made the little kids day by taking on this extra liability for presumably a ~$4 ride?   Also I don’t drive a beater, and would never transport gasoline for personal purposes in this particular vehicle. I have an older car for that. This is a 2017. "

0,"Started driving two weeks ago. General questions.Im having a good time honestly. 160ish rides and Ive only had 2 hiccups. Im in a small, densly populated town surrounded by highways, so just sticking to my town usually nets me decent earnings. Bought an iPad Pro with my earnings from last week.  1. One thing Im having trouble with is sometimes Ill see the pickup pin and the little yellow figure sometimes a block or two apart. Most of the time Ill have no trouble just going to the pin but sometimes Ill go to the pin with the figure elsewhere and when I call them theyre in a completely different address. Do we go to the pin or the little yellow man?  2. Whats the most professional and practical way to throw someone out of your car for smelling like Shreks gooch mixed with weed?  3. Does acceptance rate actually matter? I keep reading a lot of drivers here saying  that it doesnt matter at all but in those Lyft tutorial courses they make it clear that youre allowed 15 cancellations for every 100 rides (or something like that) ask because there are parts of a neighboring town I would rather avoid. Also, I dont like doing shared rides but it also seems that the people requesting shared rides also dont like sharing rides even though theyre choosing to request a shared ride.  4. Is there absolutely no way to know where a passenger is going until you pick them up?  5. Only happened once. Accidentally hit arrived for a passenger added to my queue at the airport even though I wasnt at their terminal. The way the local airport is set up is each terminal has 3 floors. If youre on a different floor and you get hailed, you have to loop all the way around. Is there away to unmark yourself as arrived and go back to navigation?  6. Surprisingly Ive only had 4 drunk passengers, and 3 of them asked me to stop at McDonalds or something. I refused all 3, told them Im only taking them to their final destination. Im within my right to do so right?"

Well I was nervous so i called back again the next day and got the same answer only that it would be 24 to 48 hours. I wait cause the original guy said it could be up to 15 days. 11 days from when I got kicked offline I call again this time they tell me I should have gotten an email from checkr the company that does the background checks. I find the email from the night it happend and it has someone elses charges on it, my father who has the same name, has a bad record DUI assault and some other shit. The email says I have 7 days to respond if anything on it is wrong but its already been 11 days.  I call the company and it has an automated message saying they have a high call volume and cant take calls. I emailed them thru the website. Called uber support right after I figured this out and the guy says I have to wait for uber to review it. I explain they are going to be reviewing the wrong info but he gave me the same answer. Today I got the email from uber saying they reviewed the record and surprise I cant drive for them any more. Im about to call customer support again and try to explain to them but I dont think it will help. Does anyone have any recommendations on what to do. Does anyone have a u.s. based help line number. I dont think the guys I keep getting connected to understand my problem or just dont care. Any advice is welcomed. Thanks all"
1,"Early pickupIm not sure if anyone can provide me with some answers here, but here goes:  Sometimes, if I cant get a ride from a co-worker, I use Uber to get to work, so I pre-schedule my rides. Usually, those show up on time, if not a few minutes after, giving me plenty of time to get ready to leave. However, my past three drivers have all been showing up anywhere between 11-15 minutes earlier than my pick up time.  For example, this morning I was set for pick up at 7:30. The app said my driver was on his way at around 7:10, he arrived at 7:19, and now Im at my destination four solid minutes before my scheduled pick up time was even set to occur. This would be fine, if it wasnt currently cold and rainy.  Whats up with this? Do I need to schedule rides late on purpose to show up on time, or am I set to be at least 30 minutes early for everything?"

The last Tuesday morning, it was really cold and I didnt feel like waiting for the EL, so I checked the ride sharing apps.  The surge prices were about double ($24) what the prices are on a good day and the closest car was 9 minutes away.  I knew that Uber taxi was just the meter and a small surcharge.  I was pretty sure that it would be less than rideshare charge, and it would probably be closer, so I went with that option and there was one only 2 minutes away.    When I got out of the taxi, I checked the meter, which read an even $17.  Thinking that I made the correct decision, I walked into my office.  Thats when I got the notification of the receipt on my phone.  I quickly checked it and saw that a charge of $30 hit my card.  ""That doesnt seem right,"" I thought to myself and checked the app, which showed the charge of $30 broken down to $28 for the fare and $2 for the ""delivery fee"".  Like I said, I knew there was going to be a surcharge, but the additional $11 dollars on the fare did not make any sense.  I sent a request to them to look at my trip and tell me why the fare was $11 more than the meter.  This was the response:   Hi PHWOFL,    Sorry to hear about the trouble.     Weve reviewed your trip. Because your final destination was in the suburbs, your fare reflects the City of Chicagos regulations. These state that trips to the suburbs must be billed for the straight metered rate to the city limits and then 1.5x the metered rate from the city limits to the suburb destination.     Metered fare rates are set by the City of Chicagos Department of Business Affairs &amp; Consumer Protection. Uber has no control over that pricing. Unfortunately, we are not able to adjust these fares.    For more info, please visit our FAQ here. The City of Chicagos site is here. Please let us know if you have questions.  Sent by Susan on Tuesday, March 5, 2019 at 8:48:29 PM  I was absolutely floored by this, as I had not gone to the suburbs.  I mean, they had access to the map of my trip, which clearly showed where I was picked up and dropped off.  So I responded:   Hi Susan,    I do not believe you reviewed my trip, or you would have seen that my final destination was &lt;my office building, which is less than a mile from the center of downtown Chicago.  This is not the suburbs.    My starting destination was also not in the suburbs.  At no point of my trip was I anywhere near the suburbs.    Please review my trip again.    Best,  PHWOFL  They emailed me back about about an hour later telling me they had brought in another team to also look at this.  I waited until Friday morning before contacting them again, asking for a status update and this is how they responded:   Hi PHWOFL,    Im sorry to hear about the trouble. Let me explain this to you.    We are glad to see that our colleague has already provided an appropriate response. We understand your experience has been frustrating, but we will be unable to provide credits or refunds for this concern.  Please know that we review our standards on a regular basis and feedback like yours is invaluable as we continue to design more helpful support experiences for our riders.  Your patience during this matter is appreciated.  Sent by AkshayJ on Friday, March 8, 2019 at 3:10:07 PM  I had a couple of problems with this email, as I felt the line ""Let me explain this to you,"" was needlessly condescending, and he ""explained"" that his colleague had already given an appropriate response.  Since I was still trying to figure why they thought I went out to the suburbs, I didnt feel that I had received an appropriate response and let them know that:   Hi Akshay,    I still do not think I was provided with an appropriate response, as I was told the reason my charge was greater than what the meter read was because I went out to the suburbs, which I did not.  The only appropriate response would be an actual explanation as to why my charge was $11 greater than the taxi meter.    Please know that I will not be using your service in the future and will be encouraging my friends and family to never use your service again, all because you decided to steal $11 from me.    Best,  PHWOFL  I was a little aggravated at this point.  The ""you decided to steal $11 from me"" was a bit much, but I feel that if they really bothered to look at this issue, they would see that it is pretty clear that I was overcharged for the trip.  Anyway, they emailed me right after saying they were still looking into this issue.  This morning, I requested a status update from them and, once again, received the ""We are still looking into this.""  Having been tired of being jerked around, I responded:  Hello Payal,    It has now been a full day since Ive heard from you and over five days since this issue happened.  This is ridiculous that no one can tell me why I was charged $11 more than what the taxi meter read.  The only response I have received is that I was taken to the suburbs, which I wasnt.  This is even more ridiculous because you have access to the map for my trip and can clearly see that I was not taken to the suburbs.  Furthermore, after not hearing back from you for another two days while ""another team was brought in to look at the issue"", I had to follow up for a status and was then told I had received an appropriate response.    Honestly, it should not take several teams of people over the course of several days to able to look at a map of Chicago and tell that I didnt go anywhere near the suburbs and was charged incorrectly.  I really want to know, is this due to indifference or incompetence?  Those are the only two reasons I can think of.  A few minutes later, I received this response:  Hi PHWOFL,      Were still looking into this issue. Well be sure to check back in with you once weve got a solution.    Thank you again for your understanding and patience.    Let me know if you have any other questions!  Sent by DW on Saturday, March 9, 2019 at 5:40:27 PM  I was just done with putting in any more time and effort into this and responded:  Hi DW,    I cant believe you are serious.  At this point, I honesty doubt that you have the capacity to come up with a solution.  Dont even bother trying.    Im deleting your app and encouraging all of my friends and family to delete it as well.      Remember, this is all because you decided to steal $11 from me.  I did not expect to receive a response, but as I was writing this, they emailed me again, thanking me for my ""understanding and  patience"" and that they still need some time to fix this issue.  My understanding and patience has run out and Ive already deleted their app (as much as you can do on an android device) and my account.  Ill just use Lyft or Via.  I havent had any problems with them.    TL:DR - Uber taxi overcharges me because they said I went to the suburbs instead of downtown.  Tried for 5 days to get some kind of answer.  Deleted the app"

1,"Frequent, tipping rider who is allergic to air freshener fragrances, seeking a ""FRAGRANCE-FREE ONLY"" checkbox in user profile.My SO has an autoimmune disease which makes her react badly to airborne chemicals. Every time we take an Uber, she immediately gets a headache and ends up with flu like symptoms for the rest of the day--body aches, nausea. She uses Uber quite often, for long (30 minutes, with tips) rides to and from work, and she basically rolls the dice on whether or not her ride will make her sick. She also gets rashes from it.  Now these little air freshener fragrances are widely regarded to be [toxic] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Air_freshener#Toxicity) but a lot of drivers do not seem to care. One friend suggested she should consider a lawsuit against Uber for exposing her to health hazards, but she is not the lawsuit type--more the kind who will just suffer in silence, which is why I am posting on her behalf.   Having read some driver opinions about this issue, the reality for drivers is that many riders are gross and leave behind gross smells that impact the way drivers are rated and treated by later customers. I get that. The problem is, I have also had conversations with drivers of fragrance-free cars, and they claim that avoiding cloth seating, airing out the car between fares, and doing some cursory seat cleaning once in a while is all their is to remaining odor-free.   I know this forum is frequented by some drivers who dont appreciate any kind of criticism of their preferred methods--but OTOH, if youre the kind of driver who goes the extra mile to make sure your car smells like nothing, without using fragrances--instead of just covering it up with carcinogens--we greatly appreciate your service, and we always tip you handsomely.  For those who swear by the air fresheners--if nothing else is wrong with the ride we will still 5 star and tip, but **I just wish there was a way we could disclose in user profiles that we are FRAGRANCE FREE riders (which is common in groceries and other products) so that you dont have even see us as fares at all, and so you wouldnt get dinged by Uber for passing on a fare.**  Thanks"

I cant find this feature in the Lyft driver app. Im considering making my default nav app google maps (standalone) if I cant view this text list within the driver app.     And no, I dont want to zoom out and look ahead on the map; for me, that is mistake prone and it takes a hell of a lot longer than reading a list.

1,"Difficulty getting ride home from LAX airportThe trip from my home to LAX cost about $60. When I attempted to get a ride from LAX back home several days later, the app told me “We’re a little busy now” and showed a price of $181 with an hour wait. There were dozens of people waiting at every “ride app waiting point” as I walked around the airport.   Is there a better way? For example, if I were to take a free shuttle to one of the local hotels a mile or two from the airport, would I have a better chance for a more reasonable price and shorter wait?"

Luckily it only damaged my driver side in the front and did not mess up the tire rod or axel, but the light broke and also the frame got pushed back to where I couldn’t turn the wheel right, I drop the rider off, which he gave me $100 (bless his heart) and I pull myself together and make my way to the nearest gas station, luckily it was all left turns.   After sitting in the gas station and calling the insurance company to see what I can do, I problem solve my way to getting my wheel to turn. I think it’s safe to go out... first hill I go down after a salt truck I lose control and hit the curb a bit. No damage, but once I saw the salt truck losing control I turn back to the gas station and write this post to tell someone about it.   Safe to say I won’t be driving Uber until I fix my car... "

0,"How to avoid deadheading home after long distance rides?I started Lyfting recently and been in a few situations where I did a ~30 mile ride to another city and had to deadhead all the way back home with no passengers at the end of the day because I couldnt get any requests with the ride filter on.  It seems either the function doesnt work properly or absolutely no one is headed my way.  Is there a solution to avoid wasting so much gas? These long rides pay well but I also lose money having to drive long distances empty.  Also, I dont feel comfortable declining rides for non-safety related reasons because my low total number of rides (21) means that turning down even one pax will tank my acceptance rate.  I also dont want to accept rides from every which way and end up 100 miles away from home at the end of the day."
0,"Is it just me or are earnings higher in the suburbs?Just a few things that I noticed the last couple weeks since I began driving in my free time. The suburbs seem to be the most profitable, at least in my area likely because of a few major malls and some casinos in the area.    Heres an example, I was driving around the city and I had a passenger go from one side of the city to the other. The trip took roughly 55 minutes and I netted about 25$. In the suburbs that same night, I had a ride that lasted 16 minutes and I needed roughly $13 which is over half the rate I got from the longer trip.    This is just one example over the last couple weeks and I am beginning to notice a trend.  Most of my rides in the city seem to be about 4-6$. Sure rides are higher in demand in the city, but I am averaging a higher hourly rate with a lessor demand which means less driving and a higher savings in gas.    Another thing in the burbs is that the rides tend to be longer and more direct. I am not waiting in traffic and burning unneeded gas.    This week I have been averaging about 28$/hr in the burbs.    What is everyone thoughts?    "

0,"Why I cancel any calls I get in Niles MichiganYouve all seen it. Youre driving and you get a ping. Trying to keep your eyes on the road, you dont process the little bit of information that Lyft sends you. I got a call earlier this month. I was in South Bend, Indiana and got a call to an street address I didnt recognize. I accepted it and drove through the bad roads to get it.  It turned out to be 19 minutes away. In all, I wasted close to an hour on this call driving there and back. And heres how the charges were split up.  [Niles Michigan fare that cost me nearly an hour.](https://i.redd.it/rcyzhd4gggj21.jpg)  I finish it up and head back to Indiana. Chalk it up as never do Niles again. Get another ping, Niles again, decide as long as Im there, Ill grab it. Half way there, ride cancels, no cancel fee. (one reason why it took nearly an hour to get back to home turf) I get another ping to go to the SB airport. He cancels because Im too far away. Another ping for Niles, but I ignore that one. Finally, as I cross back into Indiana, I get a ping 5 minutes away in South bend. Pick him up, take him to work over by the airport.  No problem. But every time Im in South Bend, I get pings to go to Niles. I dont mind an 18 minute haul in the South Bend/Elkhart area. Usually decent fares for the trip. Niles? Its a small city where the rides dont last long. A drive of about 15 miles from where I was to pick up a passenger going 1.26 miles. Took nearly 4 times as long to pick up the pax than the ride itself. Ive been suckered into two of these calls, both times the calls werent worth the time and effort. And the bastards didnt even tip, even knowing I came a long way.  Since Lyft refuses to let us know upfront what city the calls are in, Ill accept them on the fly, but the moment I find out that its Niles Michigan, I cancel the ride immediately.  I dont even bother calling. Pax get pissed at Lyft: big deal. They can call Uber and pay the long pick up fee Uber charges. (Lyft doesnt have that fee, which is why pax call us) Gas prices have been on the rise again, and even with 30+ MPG, its a major waste of gas and time for these pax.   So, if youre in Niles Michigan and get your call canceled on you, you can just look at why Lyft charges so little. "

1,"Im surprised I cant get a refund for this - The worst driver Ive ever hadI knew we were off to a great start when the driver pulled up and asked me if we were going to the airport when the destination clearly said ""train station"". As I sat in the back, he opened the door and told me to go in front ""I broke my phone stand on the way,"" he said ""so Im going to use your phone for GPS. Understood?""    I said ""sure"", asking myself why this man was talking to me like I was his child.    On the way, he kept asking me if there was a Wal-Mart in the neighborhood, I told him there wasnt any around. I thought he wanted to buy himself a new stand after dropping me off. Boy was I wrong. He wanted a new one NOW. When the driver saw what is basically a Home Depot on the side of the road he decided to go in the parking.    He stopped his car  in the middle of the way and asked me if it was okay if he went inside to get himself a new stand. I said no, that we didnt have much time -I left early, but not too early- and that I didnt mind using my phone as a GPS.    ""But what am I gonna do with the other clients?"" he asked, before running into the store.    So I sat there for several minutes, asking myself if I should cancel the ride, how long it would take to get a new one, how late I already was. When I had enough and was ready to get a new driver, the guy ran out of the store empty ended. They dont sell stands, he told me.    So he finally drove me to the train station. We had to go in circles a few times because we couldnt find the entrance. The driver had the guts to blame me for this, saying Im not telling him where to go. He doesnt realize I really have no interest staying in his car, if I knew the way I would have told him.    Finally, I got out of his car at 4:49. My train was at 4:50. As I entered the station, I saw that it was pretty much empty, there were employees, but no passengers. I approached gate 15 where I was supposed to take my train and saw that the stairs were blocked. A few seconds later, I felt the ground shaking under me. The train is gone. These minutes I spent waiting for him to get a new phone stand, and the ones we spent going in circles could have changed everything.  According to Uber, this isnt ground for a full refund. They gave me a few bucks back and a credit for my next ride when I pressed support about how bad the situation was."

0,"Passenger leaves car, won’t end rideI’m a new driver, and I can’t figure out the best way to deal with a situation I had tonight.   I picked up a passenger who stayed in my car for a minute, then jumped out at the first stop light and ran after her friend, leaving her purse in the car. I thought she might return to the car, but she ended up just grabbing her purse and saying “I can’t!” And then running away before I could ask her to cancel her ride.   So I’m sitting there with a ride in progress but no passenger.   So what should I do at that point? I tried to end the ride, but it asked me why I didn’t take them to their destination, options being “I don’t want this ride” or “other”.  I clicked other, but I still won’t get a cancellation fee and I waste my time for their decision to bolt.   But it’s also a waste of time if I sit there waiting for them to maybe remember to cancel their ride as they get further and further away from my car.   Any insight?"

It took 40 minutes of arguing with the representative who did not understand my problem at all before I asked to speak with their supervisor. The supervisor, after another 20 minutes, finally got an answer and explained to me that because my account is under the name Anthony and my insurance is under the name Tony, it cannot be approved. Literally nothing has changed about my insurance. Ive ALWAYS had the name Tony, the addresses match from my registration, my DL, and my Insurance card. The signature on my DL and my Social Security card are both Tony. Ive been driving for over 3 years with my insurance as Tony, only now for some ridiculous reason theyre fighting me. Its enfuriating as Ive been trying to drive for 3 days and missed this entire weekend of revenue.

1,"Uber Eats allows drivers to take your food and then expects you to pay for it.DONT USE UBER EATS  I have been an uber and uber eats customer fo a long time and use their service regularly. Those days are over. Last night I placed an order through Uber eats for a restaurant I have ordered from multiple times and was monitoring for the order to be picked up. The time was pushed back 15 minutes and the status still said ""Order being prepared."" I refreshed the app multiple times making sure it wasnt frozen. About an hour and ten minutes after placing the order, I get a notification that my order was cancelled. I checked my phone, no missed calls. I call customer support to check whats going on. They tell me that they can see on their end that the courier arrived at my location and attempted to call me and canceled after waiting 10 minutes.  I explain to them that I had been monitoring the app and hadnt recieved any calls. They keep telling me that the courier called me. I asked them to give me a refund. They refused. I asked them to call the courier and have him bring my food to me and Ill wait outside at the street for him to arrive. They tell me hes already on another fare.    I end up talking to the supervisor who continues to insist that Im lying about not receiving a call. He gives me a unmonitored email address to send my call history to dispute the charge that shoots back an email saying that the email wont be read please use the app. I then call back to find out how I can get them documentation showing I never recieved any calls from the courier. I sent the info to them and went to bed.   I woke up this morning to a stock reply to my message saying that the order cannot be refunded because the driver attempted to make contact with me.  I call customer service back. Im angry now. The same response, they imply that Im lying and refuse a refund.   I respond through email to them that I will be disputing a charge with my credit card company, and that if I dont recieve a refund, I will take legal action against them for fraud. About 2 minutes later I get a refund. This is after theyve wasted at least 2 hours of my time, not to mention I had to re order the food they didnt deliver and go pick up the order myself.  Long story short, dont use uber eats. They will steal your food, attempt to make you pay for it, call you a liar when you call them out on their bullshit, then make you jump through hoops to get your money back. DONT USE UBER EATS"

0,Avoiding long rides..Hello all. Ive found r/Lyft to be very helpful and have searched for this topic without success. I Lyft part-time typically on my way home. Normally I can do 4-5 rides in a hour from my office to my house in under two hours. Today I accepted a ride that was 20 mins away from me and took me 25 miles away from my house. Once I dropped off the PAX I waited 30 mins in the undesirable Town 25 miles away from my area. Then decided to drive back to my town. In my opinion I should have been compensated for 2-way miles but I get the app platform. Question is is there a way to avoid these type of rides? Dont get me wrong I made okay money but could have made more if I just stayed in my area. Thanks

0,"Cant drive for Lyft for 6 months because the background check company they use mishandled my applicationIve been a part-time driver with lyft for 4 years, and a couple months back I was asked to resubmit my info for a background check.  They advised me to contact them if more than two weeks had passed since I submitted my info and I hadnt heard from them. So 3 weeks after, I emailed support to ask for the status of my background check, and what ended up happening was that there was miscommunication between lyft and the company they use for background checks. They told me to sit tight as they figured out how to resolve the issue.  A few weeks pass by and I email lyft support again asking if there was any updates, and I was told that my background check was still in progress.  I let a couple weeks go by, and email them again, only to receive a response that says that my account has been suspended for 6 months due to an inability to verify my information. I emailed back asking what information wasnt able to be verified, and got not response.  I went ahead and drove to the lyft hub to talk to someone in person, so that I could figure out what went wrong, so that I could make sure everything went smoothly the next time I was eligible to drive.  After explaining the situation and the lyft hub rep finished chatting with support, they informed me that there has been technical issues with how their background check company are handling background checks, and that its happening to a number of lyft drivers (at least in the area). They told me that unfortunately due to federal law, even though it was their mistake, they can not allow me to drive for at least 6 months.  Im pretty bumbed out about this, as I have been a driver for quite a while and now all I can do is wait until they let me drive again, and hope that they dont screw up my background check again.

It was dismissed, but would this affect my eligibility? (It is still visible in background checks, and shows it was dismissed in the record)"
1,"I drive crazy and rough but you love it??So, I drive a lot in this small university town that’s next to a big city. So it’s a really nice town. There’s mostly uni/college students that I’m giving rides to.  Some background on my driving. I am a CRAZY driver(and a girl. Also what’s up with the “girls drive slow” thing? All the girls I know drive like maniacs and the guys drive like old people.) The city I live in has no police at all. They’re too busy responding to shootings to care about speeding. So, when I drive for Uber, I’ve always felt that my driving was great! I drive slower, I’m not slamming on my brakes, I’m not careening around corners, etc... But the other day, I drove a guy home and he told me right when we pulled up to his home “thank you so much, you drive so rough and fast, you got me home so fast!” I thought he was being sarcastic, so I did a really awkward laugh and apologized. He very adamantly said “No! I’m serious. That was great. You got me home very fast! Thank you. Everyone else always takes forever.”  So I know he meant it as a compliment but now I’m just wondering if all my other passengers are thinking about how rough and fast I’m driving?  I picked up some young guys who smelled hecka strong of week, so I figured they’d be chill (they were) and I told them what they guy said and asked if I drove crazy. They both said that I was driving fast but they loved it. They said that other drivers always go super slow. I’ve also had other passengers say that they’re happy I’m voing fast. But it’s always when I don’t mean to be speeding.  Personally, I’m finding this very embarrassing. I genuinely thought I was driving great. Is this a bad thing?"

I suggest working airport on Thursday and hotels and popular restaurants, it will be surging like crazy but don’t go near the center where the event is held! Work the outskirts of town and you’ll bank because Uber did quest promotions for one ride up to $5 plus surge but you can’t find passengers. So do your normal bar runs and occasionally scoop up these event goers. Not a single tip from one of them btw! Good luck 👍 "

1,"Had a bad Uber ride in a Telsa Model 3 today. I was afraid.At first I thought it would be cool since I had never ridden in a Telsa, and that part was cool, but the driver was so distracted with looking at the screen and playing with some of the controls that he literally almost got in to 3 accidents on my short trip. He even activated the self driving mode while on the freeway, which I was fine with since that was doing a better job of driving than he was.   I think Im going to have to report this driver.  While he was driving, he literally had to swerve to avoid a car stopped at a light and then he had to brake really hard at the last second at another intersection.   Whats odd is that he has a high driver rating and has been driving with Uber for 4 years. He probably just got the car and was too distracted by it or something. "

Had a girl backed her Jeep into the car today, and put a huge crack in the bumper. Police report filed but officer almost cited me for driving without insurance. He said he found a form that said I was self insured. Checked it and pointed out that the form said HERTZ filed self insurance. Not uncommon for large businesses to self insure. I didnt get cited for no insurance.  Good thing, because, even though I wasnt at fault, it still could have cost between $250 and $1000  in fines, plus license suspension (90 days to 1 year) as well as having to purchase higher priced insurance. He put down the insurer as Hertz Corporation, as the form said, but he still needed a policy number, which was not available.

Yet it’s not displaying what the possible PT it is and all rides that I receive (and they’re coming to me back to back as I decline them) aren’t displaying any PT.  It’s my belief that Lyft is no longer displaying PT to get drivers to accept any and all rides.

He laughed and said its because his house is on that side of the road, and surely it was true-- a one way street with his house on the left. Im more relieved now. "

I was initially told I would need to wait 30 days before I would be emailed a PIN to complete the transfer. I never received that message. I was also told it “wouldn’t be a problem” to transfer and that I need not wait that month. Apparently that was wrong too.  Do you all have any ideas to get a resolution? I have sent so many messages, and I get the same canned response every time. I asked why couldn’t they look at my deactivated account, see the credit was there, verify my info, cancel the PIN that was supposedly sent, and either issue a new one with a confirmation code or manually move the funds. They keep saying they’re “waiting for another team to respond and thank me for my patience.” I normally wouldn’t worry too much about it, but it’s ~ $50. "

0,"question about lyft navigation &amp; do I need a new phone?Im a new Lyft driver, this is my first week.  This morning all was fine until I got this guy who helpfully gave better directions than the navigation provided by Lyft.  We talked the whole time and all was good but the Lyft app navigation (Google maps?) couldnt seem to catch up with where my car actually was and was giving all these odd ball directions.  Luckily he knew the way so as we chatted he directed me to where he was going.  During the drive I got another ""scheduled"" ride.  So I dopped off the first passenger and then headed to the next one.  At this point, navigation reset and seemed to be back on track.  On the way to the next pax, one of the right turns was a bit tricky and I misunderstood and took it too early.  I tried to follow along the GPS but it was like this glitch where the GPS was behind where I actually was.  It wouldnt find me and recalculate the directions.  So I finally find the pax, by this time Im a little late, and its a long ride to the airport.  I had to use my back up GPS device - like physically unplug my phone charger and plug in this GPS device because by now the Lyft navigation had it all wrong.  I got the lady to her airport and made it my last ride but Im afraid to continue driving with the screwy Lyft GPS.    The lady wondered if it was a data problem, which it might be?  I have a Motorola X Pure, its maybe 2 years old, and Republic Wireless.  I added 3 GB data to it and when I checked at home after driving it was at 2.7-2.8 GB left.    Im just wondering if I need a newer phone and an unlimited plan to avoid the Lyft GPS glitching or if it happens to other drivers and maybe its just a temporary glitch?  If it matters, I drive in the SF Bay Area.    Thanks in advance, appreciate any insight."

0,All the Bad Things About Uber and Lyft In One Simple List 
0,"I got accused of being high/drunk while driving Lyft last night, and it was bs.So I’ve been driving for Lyft for 6 months. It’s my full time job. I live in New Orleans, a big tourist city, so money is always good here. I’m a Platinum driver with a 5.0 star rating(4.9 now because of this). I’ve completed over 1,600 rides since I’ve started. I love driving for Lyft. I love driving. I’d like to think I’m always nice to my customers and provide them with a comfortable and safe ride. Well one person decided that for some reason that they either didn’t like me or that they wanted to not pay for the ride, hours after being dropped off.  So this person, whom I do not know, reported the ride I gave them saying that I was under the influence of drugs or intoxicated. They did this at 3:30am. I got the email reporting that my driver account was deactivated around this time. I got a follow up email from Ms. Georgia in the Trust and Safety Department at 5:30am asking when is a good time to call to address the issue. I was asleep for all of this. I wake up at 10am, go out to drive at 11am. Find out I can’t drive because of everything listed above. I write a response saying I’m available whenever and give them my number. Half an hour later Ms. Georgia calls me and just wants for me to explain my side of things.  Here’s the truth. I am not on drugs, I do not partake in any illegal drugs. I have prescriptions for non-narcotics that do not effect my alertness or reflexes. I do not drink (funny because I live in the city where everyone gets drunk on a nightly basis). In fact the last time I drank alcohol was last year around this time for my sister’s wedding. Ms. Georgia told me she understood at that the email complaint was very vague as to how I was acting, and that after 1,600+ rides, this was my first report filed against me. She apologized for the inconvenience and reactivated my driver account.   It is now end of day for me. I drove for 8 hours, made $150, and made it home before 9pm to spend time with my family before we go to bed. Thank you Ms. Georgia for recognizing a bs complaint and helping me to take care of my family. And to the rider who thought that I was a pushover they could take advantage of, I hope you get nothing less that 300% surge charges for the rest of the time you’re in town.

0,"Overcharged due to driver going to the wrong address, getting the runaround in getting charges fixedWeve been trying to get this fixed for weeks now and Lyft has been completely unhelpful, if anyone has advice for how or if its possible to get this situation fixed I would appreciate hearing from you.  ***tl;dr:*** Driver entered the wrong address in Google Maps and took us there by mistake. Lyft wont refund us for the incorrect route because when we realized we were in the wrong area we decided to go home instead of to our original destination, costing us ~$50 extra.  A couple of weeks ago my spouse and I were planning to take a ride to a store a few miles away from our apartment, go shopping, and then take another ride home. The Lyft driver we had entered the wrong address in Google Maps (ignoring the Lyft app directions) and took us in completely the wrong direction. We were about 14 miles in the wrong direction when we noticed we werent headed the right way.  At that point we realized the store we wanted to go to would be closed by the time we got there, so we just changed the destination to our home address instead. Big mistake, apparently since the address was changed it means they absolutely will not refund any part of the ride. Even though the Lyft drivers mistake turned what should have been a 10 mile trip into a 30 mile trip that cost us nearly $70 (quoted price around $20).  I understand there are probably plenty of people who write to Lyft customer support for stupid reasons and need it explained to them that you cant just add a destination and expect the price to stay the same, but thats not happened with us. I would be more than happy to pay what it would have cost to drive us  the correct route, but because we cant get it adjusted were paying easily 3x the quoted price for the drivers mistake.   Weve been back and forth with Lyft several times and they just keep giving us the same canned response: I understand you were quoted a different price, but since the destination changed the price changed. If Id known this was going to happen I would have just let the driver take us to the closed store and called a different driver to take us home. I also dont understand why they cant look at their records to see that the driver took us in completely the wrong direction *before* we changed our destination.  Does anyone have advice or similar experiences?"

1,"Uber eats driver claimed they couldnt get to me and canceled the orderHello all, I drive for Uber and use their service as well so I know what goes on on both sides.  I ordered some food with Uber eats and its not my first time. And I get to my door when it says 1 minute away and I never had a problem getting to the door before the driver.  So this time I did the same thing. I went out to my door to wait for the driver then theres a message on the app saying they made a contact. I never got a phone call.  And the app still shows they were about a block away (at this time i was standing at my porch) and I can see the driver on the app pass my house, one block down and then make circles and parked at a near by gas station to wait fro their 8 minute timer to expire to cancel my order.  As a driver, I know there are ""loopholes"" for a lack of a better word, to make this feat possible.  Once the driver gets to a certain radius , they can say on the app the are there etc. I tired to contact for help through the app asking for a refund and got generic responses say the driver made reasonable contact and in short denied my claim.  I asked to get it escalated to a manager or supervisor but havent received a response.  Any tips or experience how to get my money back?"

1,"Help: Uber Driver took advantage of my elderly momSo my mom is in her 70s, cannot drive due to partial blindness.  She took an Uber from her house to her doctors (like a $7 fare).    The POS driver asked her to unlock her phone and show him her destination as ""it was not showing up on his app.""  Mom did this.  Today she awoke to a fucking $111 charge for a two hour ride she did not take.  To make matters worse, the POS driver charged her for vomiting in his car.  My mom did no such thing.    Any one have any idea how to fight this?    Of course, we had mom change her Uber and phone passwords, cancel her credit cards and will be filing a complaint with Uber.  Thinking about filing a police report too.    Any of you ever heard of such a scam?    EDIT:   Looked at moms bank charges and in addition to the $111 ride she also had three separate charges from Uber that day for $38.75 and 98.45; plus $50, 137.50 and 161.24 the next day. Not sure which one of those is the fake ""vomit"" charge.  Those charges do not show up on her Uber app so she is contesting directly with bank. All told, she is out about $546.64. "

I was out of the work for the rest of the night and will be today as well, as it still smells and is stained. There are stains that I cant get out and it took me hours to clean, and I spent at least $50 on cleaning supplies, etc.   Lyft responded and said they charged the passenger $50! Is there anything I can do? The damage is terrible and I would think it would warrant the maximum of $250! I have never reported for a cleaning fee before, and have a 4.99 rating with hundreds of rides.  Here are the pictures I submitted to Lyft support with my initial request: https://imgur.com/a/DfXf2TH   Update:  Thanks so much for the advice everyone. I ended up submitting another damage complaint for the ride explaining the situation and hoping someone else would review it. They said they raised the damage fee to $100, and asked me to get an estimate if I thought the damage was more severe. Ill be going to the dealership today, hopefully with the estimate they will be able to charge more, Ill keep the post updated."

The driver put my luggage in the back. I wasnt able to make out what the damage was in the picture they sent. They say it is not open for discussion. I am so upset. $150 is more than 10% of my income. I had not been drinking. I did nothing wrong. The driver is just lying. I know there is nothing I can do. I cant afford a lawyer. I cant dispute the charges on my cc. From now on I am going to take pictures of the vehicle when I get out with my time stamped camera.   Thats the end of my rant. Ive read the other Lyft posts and no one had any ideas on pursuing this without getting barred from Lyft. I can use uber but it is more expensive.

I try to gauge the type of driver I get so if they are a talker, Ill talk and if they are more reserved Ill be polite and quite. I always ask if they prefer my bag in the trunk or back seat, and only travel with one or two small bags. What did I do?  Should I be tipping in cash? Will this rating affect future pickups?

The driver was super nice and said ""help yourself to a beverage or snack, theyre there for you, if youd like any""  I didnt even take a drink or snack, and probably most wont, but its a brilliant idea b/c passengers will then want to tip you in order to pay for the drink/bottled water and your profit margin will be higher than what they cost you.   And the Rick Astley was just pain funny.  I ended up tipping $5. because it brightened my day big time. "

Then about an hour later (WAY after the point where the Bangladesh dip-shit couldve stopped the order after the restaurant received it), I check the app, and found out that not only was no one notified of the switch, but its en-route, TO THE OLD FUCKING ADDRESS. To make matters worse, the poor guy delivering it was riding a bicycle.    After calling back, got another person, who couldnt speak English worth a shit. Who proceeded to not also be inept at understanding plan, fucking, English, but had an accent so bad that the delivery guy had to call me to get the address.

0,"Driver had a Stranger in the Backseat.Yesterday I ordered a lyft private ride to a museum with my girlfriend. When the driver arrived we were extremely confused to find a man in the backseat. The driver assured us that this was our ride and the license plate and vehicle matched up. He also told us that the man in the backseat had his ride cancelled and that he was taking him to his destination as well.   We allowed the driver to take us to our destination and reached out to lyft after the ride. The fare we paid for was for a private ride, but Lyft refuses to make any changes to the charge while referring to the “no refunds” clause of the terms of service. Is this appropriate even when we did not get the service we paid for?  Edit:  From the Lyft app “Lyft: a personal ride to get to your destination quickly. Fits up to 4 people”.   “Line: a shared ride with others going the same way. Price is always less than a standard lyft”  I received neither a personal ride. Nor a car that fits up to 4 people. What I got was a shared ride with someone going the same way. As it says, price is always less than a standard lyft and I believe I should only have to pay that rate "

0,"Passenger Grocery Etiquette?(TL;DR at the end)  Hello, I’m a college student who moved into a city area about 6 months ago, and it’s my first time on my own. Navigating how I want to go about grocery shopping has been a bit of a hassle. As of late I have been using Instacart, but have been experiencing different issues about every time recently, and honestly I would rather be the one picking out my food, plus shopping in person vs Instacart saves money. I’ve thought about possibly taking public transportation to the store and requesting a Lyft back to my apartment with the groceries. The store I’m wanting to shop at is about 1.75 miles away and I’d be getting enough groceries for just myself for the month. If I were to go ahead with this, what’s the etiquette for it that would make it the easiest and most seamless for the driver? Or is this something that I shouldn’t be using Lyft for? I’ll of course be more than willing to load all of the groceries myself, and would unload them just to the front door of my building, which is about 5 steps off of the curb. And of course a tip, but what would you suggest the appropriate tip would be? I don’t really have too big of a grocery fund and if I’m not able to give an appropriate tip for the nature of the trip then I’d rather just not do it at all. Thank you in advance, drivers!!  TL;DR: I’m considering using Lyft to bring home groceries, what’s the proper passenger etiquette for this, or should I not do it at all?"

0,"Can anyone tell me why lyft has sucked these past few monthsI started using Uber about 3 years ago back in 2016. It was super convenient for me because at the time I was living up at college with no car. Easily took over a hundred rides throughout the course of 2 years. Never had any issues with Uber. Then I started hearing all these things about Lyft so I thought I’d download the app and cross compare between Uber to see which prices were cheaper depending on where I was going. 9/10 times it was Lyft that ended up being cheaper. Never had a problem with Lyft until around a few months ago. Ordered a Lyft (a relatively short ride, about 10 mins total). When it got to be a few blocks away the countdown started ticking that we had to be in the car. It was still a decent distance away, even if we could walk the distance it would be impossible to make it in that time. Called the driver multiple times, didn’t answer. Eventually hit with the no show fee. Great. This similar situation has happened multiple times. Then last week I had the pleasure of having someone else “steal my ride”. Long story short, ordered an Lyft. Said the guy was 4 minutes away. When he was 2 minutes away the clock started clicking that we’re departing soon. Called him, no answer. He then starts going away from our location. I thought maybe he was turning around and the GPS kept rerouting him. After rerouting 4 times I figured he wasn’t showing up. Called him again, no answer. Then all the sudden it changes to the screen to tip/rate my driver as if I’m taking a ride. He ended up picking someone else up like a mile away from where he was supposed to pick me up. I contacted Lyft right away (customer service sucks it’s all through email with is frustrating, but they are fast I’ll give them that). Ended up refunding me the money. But still. I don’t understand why I keep having these issues with Lyft. I deleted the app and will only stick with Uber because I feel that even if I have to pay extra for Uber, the service is worth it. I’m starting to think Lyft drivers are seriously underpaid because of the amount of shitty drivers I’ve encountered. It would make sense because like I said before, 9/10 times Lyft fares are cheaper. I need a drivers perspective here. I’m genuinely curious as to why Lyft drivers have been doing this lately. Is there a reason behind this? Because my friends have been running into similar problems with them too. "

So I have to wait two days to expense my rides, because my employer, justifiably, requires a date on every expense. It negates the benefit of using an expenses app that enables real-time reporting.

1,Removing a discount?Is it going to sound very odd but I always keep on getting these discounts there really good like 50% off  and stuff but I also have a few 10$ off rides  like multiple I cant use both at once but I would really like to remove the discounts I get to use my free 10$ Im on a very low budget as of right now so paying only like 1$ for a ride across town would be a life saver for me

1,"I take Uber to and from work...5 days a week, sometimes 6. Its not far from where I live. Initially the cost was $6-7.50 one way. However after about a month of taking uber. My price on my trip home started to increase. $10, $11, $12. So on and so forth. My trip in the morning only jumped about a dollar but basically stayed the same. Today I went to call an uber home and they wanted to charge me $17! Its literally a 5-8 minute ride with traffic...   Why would uber be doing this to a frequent rider, and why is my trip back so expensive. Ive opted out for taking the bus back home to stick it to them because I think that price is ludicrous. "

1,"Wait times ?So I took a trip to the store and the driver wanted to know if she should wait. I asked how does that work and she said she does not know but if I am only going to be a few minutes, it will probably be cheaper than calling for a new ride. So anyway, was in the store for maybe 10 minutes and she waited and took me home. Total cost of the trip appears to be slightly less than calling for a new ride one way. How does waiting work cost wise. "

1,"question regarding lux chargelast weekend i requested an uber during sxsw and am having a lot of problems because of one specific trip. i’ll try to bulletpoint it from start to most recent to try to make it more understandable.   - get in uber at 1:52am - get dropped off at 2:04am - think nothing of it because it seemed like a normal uber ride  - at 5:30am the same day i am charged $150 for making a mess but don’t notice it until yesterday  - yesterday i look at my bank statements and see i was charged $83 for the initial ride and $150 for   - freak out - immediately submit a claim for “damage” done  - said claim is almost immediately refunded back to me after getting a sweet picture of vomit  - today i don’t really know what to do about the $83  details:  it’s completely unlike me to request a “premium” vehicle, or request something higher than $30 for an 11 minute ride, but i will admit i don’t use uber very often (i use lyft) so maybe it’s possible that they were like there’s no uberx’s available in your area do you want a to get a lux? and maybe i pressed yes, but that seems unlikely during sxsw. i should also note that the girl i was with was kind of being a drunk dick to the driver and while i had a few i was completely aware of everything going on. i’m assuming (hoping) that he just mistakenly blamed our ride for the vomit so no harm there. but my question is, is it possible for the driver to switch from the standard to lux either before pickup or during the ride? i’ll completely own this charge if it was my fault, but i just want to make sure nothing questionable was going on.  thanks "
1,"Daimler, BMW Put Up $1 Billion to Battle Uber, Lyft "
1,"Am I throwing away money or does this make sense?I have a question about flat rate - obvious answer is obvious. Who pays the flat rate minimum surge guarantee?   I assume the rider does. This is an interesting dilemma for me. I drive premium in a WEAK uber market. I rarely can find rides. When I get into a surge area the minimum surge guarantee shows up. Because my area has so few riders what usually happens is I dont get any rides. So, now I will literally be driving around with an extra $5 to $10 price tag on my vehicle because the minimum surge doesnt go away. (I guess this is good for moving between surge areas -- which I dont have here.) What I usually do once I decide to move on from an area is, after driving for a while, I log out and log back in to remove the extra price, to increase my chances of getting a premium. Does this make sense?"

0,"A Lyft Driver just left me stranded at the Airport to take another Passenger Right in front of me. Lyft Customer assistance told me I didnt spend enough to be compensated.I would like to get some advice on what my next course of action should be, whether it be a BBB complaint or a chargeback.    I arrived at Tampa Airport after a long day of travel, and a long week away from home. I really really just wanted to get home.  Important Note: I had a carry-on, lunch box (personal Item), and one checked ""box"" which was pretty large and weighed 50lbs.  Becuase I had this box (no wheels, just a cardboard box), I wasnt able to use the restroom in the airport.  Contributing to me just really really wanted to get home.    Once I got my luggage, I requested a lyft ride, a Driver (Driver A) confirmed, and the map came up, showing he was 10 minutes away.  I moved to the curb area with my luggage and sat on a bench watching the map.   Pretty on time with the 10 minutes, I can see on the map he is coming up the aisle for pick-up, so I move my luggage to the very curb and spot the car and hold my hand up.  He stops 50-100 feet short.  I wave, then look at my phone.  It says the Driver cancelled my ride.  Another passenger gets in his back seat and he drives off.    I was livid.    I schedule another lyft, and a driver confirms (Driver B).  I call this driver, tell him what happened and beg him not to cancel on me.  Driver B was 15 minutes away.  He told me he would definitely pick me up.  Driver B was excellent no complaints.    I get home.  I request a call from the lyft app or website or something.   Lyft calls me, tells me to hold. I hold a long time.  Customer Service Rep A (CS A) comes on the line.  I explain the situation. He agrees its bad, apologizes.  I ask him to be compensated.  He puts me on hold to review some things, comes back on the line and explains that he is looking at my passenger history and ""There isnt a whole lot here"".   (This was my 3rd ride this week (to from airport/hotel/etc)) For that reason he couldnt compensate me. It had maybe been 1 year since my last lyft.    Granted I wasnt expecting much, but even if they threw a $5 credit at me, I would expect that the driver would get a ding on his record, or something.    I tell CS A that Im not satisfied with that and would like to speak to his manager.   I spent another long time on hold.   His manager (CS B) basically spends 10-15 minutes on the phone with me telling they wont do anything becuase of policy.    He wasnt rude, but literally he didnt care a single ounce about my situation.  I asked to speak to his manager and the basic respond was no, email a complaint.  I asked for an email address and he wouldnt give me one.    So now, Im pretty much ticked off enough to charge back all three of my rides this week ($80ish).   However I really dont want the Drivers who actually gave me a good ride to be somehow punished for the chargeback. These were good guys, honest people just trying to make a living.    Is it Lyft policy to punish drivers in a charge-back situation.    Otherwise, Im willing to pay the fee and file a complaint with the BBB.  But that will problem get lost somewhere in a pile of paperwork.    TL;DR:   Driver A left me stranded at the Airport picked up a different Passenger Right in front of me. Lyft Customer assistance told me I didnt spend enough money to be compensated."
1,"Can you get a refund for getting pulled over?Sorry, new poster here. I was getting a ride home from a party when my driver got pulled over for headlight that was out. The girl that was paying for our ride however was freaking out and needed to get home ASAP and was delayed because the driver didn’t have his stuff together . Can either she or I report a claim and help her get her money back?  EDIT: thanks for the feedback everybody. A common theme I’m seeing is if the driver was aware his headlight was out. He told the officer he was aware the light was out and he set up an appointment to get it fixed next week. I’m not sure if there’s any legitimacy to that claim but that’s what he told the officer. He was also very upset and told us multiple times that it was unfair that so many people in town have headlights out but they singled him out. "

1,"This to consider as an Uber PassengerThis has probably been recycled a few times. But a quick refresher doesnt hurt.  * We dont get tipped as frequently as you think we do, its not rare but uncommon. We dont really expect it. But Uber themselves take a huge chunk out of what youre paying. So just know if youre paying 10 bucks for a ride. Were getting 7 of that. * If youre 16 minutes away and your ride is a mile or two. Just fucking tip dude. I know that contradicts statement 1, but that is just plain ridiculous. Were giving you a ride that took us 20-25 minutes for 3 dollars. * Downtown if we park across the street. Just cross the street. Dont expect us to cut a U-Turn. Or do another complete lap on that 1 way just to park infront of you. * Single passengers sit in the back (for the most part). We appreciate your enthusiasm for conversation, however, you cause distractions. * Dont ever EVER say ""we can all squeeze in"" if you have one extra person. One of you is not going point blank. Or just pay for the XL. * Your friends house isnt ""just up the road"" I dont care if its your dollar, its our time. Add the damn stop, or just tip cash in that moment. Were trying to make money not toss around constant favors. * BE WHERE YOU SAY YOU ARE, or turn on your PERSONAL LOCATION. * Lastly, dont hit on your drivers. Its super irritating. Were trying to take home some change for providing a service. Leave it at that.   Edit: To clear things up with statement 2. Before we pick you up, we do not know where your going. The only information we have is what your name is and where you’re at."
0,"Absurd Lyft treatment of gift card creditOn Uber, if you have gift card credit, its treated like ""cash"" (i.e. you spending your money on rides). On Lyft, however, its treated as generic ""promo"" credit after being added, which means Lyft treats it as indistinguishable from, say, ""promo"" credit gifted after a customer service incident. What this means is that when Lyft offers, say, a 50% off 10 rides promo, people with gift card credit are forced to use their gift card credit and \*pay full price.\* Before a ride, you cant even change payment method and select not to use the gift card/""promo"" credit -- youre literally forced to do so instead of saving it for later and paying cash to take advantage of the 50% off promo. This is an awful anti-consumer practice.  tl;dr Dont buy gift cards for Lyft "

In case anyone asks why not just pay cash I still prefer the safety of having the trip tracked by Lyft for longer trips, particularly because Ill be on crutches for this particular ride.   Edit: Just to clarify I would ask the driver in advance on the initial trip to see if they were interested in taking me back and avoid an empty ride back since it will be a long trip. "

0,"Just quit my retail job to drive full-time!This post isnt meant to glorify quitting your day job to become a full time driver. I just wanted to share my personal experience.     Ive been working a dead-end retail job for almost the past year where Im underpaid and have been turned down for promotions. Im a hard worker and basically have just been taken advantage of. Today I decided I had enough and turned in my work keys and left. I know its risky but I just felt that it was a risk I needed to take, especially for my mental health as this job just absolutely sucked my soul.     So, heres to the future! I know theres still a lot to learn about driving full time but Im going to do the best. The most stressful part is trying to tax myself so I have money for next tax season, and keeping track of my mileage. But I believe it will be completely worth it for now. If anyone has tips or advice Id love to hear it!   Edit: Im only doing this temporarily for 3/4 months while searching for a new job. Seem to be getting lots of hate for no reason "
0,"Phantom rides, delayed pickupOften when I request a ride Lyft shows me a normal-looking name, face and license plate with the message that my ride will be here in (for example) 4 minutes. Then, while Im standing on the sidewalk waiting I get a new message with a different name, face, and license plate and new arrival time estimate farther in the future. Sometimes this happens three times before a car arrives, 10 or more minutes later than the original prediction.   I switched to Lyft (from Uber) in January because friends told me Lyft is a more humane employer, but I am finding Lyft unreliable. The broken promises about when my car will show up remind me why I stopped using taxis.   I am in Los Angeles. Is this typical of riding Lyft here?"
1,"Ubers idiotic signup broke my accountSo I decided I wanted to try uber eats with my bicycle. Seemed simple enough. But as I was making my account I accidentally hit the using a car button instead of a bicycle. No big deal right? Just go back and select the bike option right? Welllllllll no uber doesn’t have that option. Like literally they don’t have a back option for that and every-time you try to hit the work for uber option it brings you right back where you left off no matter what. I went into a live chat and they literally told me that there is NO option to go back and that the account is now useless. (Fun fact, you can’t delete the account if its connected to an email according to the guy). So what? Just make a new account right? Use another email right? Welllllll... kinda. So I did that. But guess what? If you use one phone number for uber you can’t log in to any other account using that phone number. It just... wont let you. So if I wanted to make another account (my third at this point) I would have to change my phone number.   Now here is another funny thing. I decided that maybe I should change my password for one account so it wont bring me back the the first broken account so it could differentiate between the two while logging in. Buuuuut no uber thinks now that I ONLY want to log in to the useless account that I can’t change. So because I used the same phone number it broke the system and changed the other password and now both passwords show up as wrong for each account. Even when I change the password it brings me to a verify email screen and then brings me back to the login with my phone number and says the password is wrong.   Note that all this could have been avoided if the added a go back option in the setup for wether i’m using a vehicle or not. "

Im asking because I have a 2 hour ride coming up and want to know if I need to call the driver to let them know or if the app will tell them where Im going before they accept.   Also, if I call and they dont want to take the long trip whos responsibility is it to cancel the ride? "
1,"Calling uber for someone else in AustraliaHey everyone!    I was looking for ways to call an uber for someone else, and I was happy to find that its a well-supported feature. I went to the app to test it out (the person in question will need it in a few hours), but the option to select the person taking the ride is missing (it was shown on news articles, youtube videos showcasing the feature etc.). Is it something that might not be available in Australia, or they changed how it works?    I know we can set up a family account, and Im OK with that, but Im curious if Im just clumsy or this feature doesnt work in AU (or its been disabled? the articles are from 2017)?"

When I inquired what sort of cleaning, Uber customer support sent me a picture of vomit on the car floor. Now this was a 4 min trip from a conference center to the holtel I was staying in.    This was a work trip and so I was obviously not drunk and did not vomit during that trip. How do I get this wrongful charge off my card?  Edit: Contacted Uber and told them that this wasnt me and either Im being charged for another customers fault or this is fraudulent. Had a couple of emails back and forth but they refunded me the cleaning amount."

Ive been thinking of trying working for Uber but I have some questionsI currently work as a truck driver but as one of the newer guys its going to take a while before I gain seniority and more hours. Would I make enough as an Uber/lyft/delivery driver to pay for a car loan and related expenses? My schedule at work is quite odd so I cant find a part time job that I can work around those hours.

1,"Riders, is the look of a car important vs how clean it is inside?I ask this question because my Toyota Camry engine went and was too expensive to fix so I bought a buffer car to save up for what I really want. My buffer car is a 2004 Chrysler Sebring. Very clean and got lucky with it at 54k miles only. I’ve already been approved by lyft and waiting on Uber.   My concern is on the outside the paint is dulling a little in some spots because the age of the vehicle. Can’t see at first glance unless you really inspect it. Car drives good, breaks amazingly, very smooth. Inside is clean and smell good. I’m just afraid because I don’t want my rating to take a nose dive because the paint isn’t the best looking on the outside upon inspection.   I wanted to know if something like this would affect your rating with a driver because of that? Would love your honest opinion on this. Thanks. "

1,"He Had a Stroke -- My Uber Story*Hi everyone, I am an Uber driver who likes to share my stories from the road.  I find we see so many interesting things in a day and meet such interesting people.  Driving has certainly helped restore some of my faith in humanity as I find the vast majority of riders are kind and have great life experience to share.  I know we always seem to hear about the horrible riders that cause us grief, but I think there is a positive light out there for drivers that very few people get to see.*     **He Had a Stroke**  I generally don’t get the chance to drive in the morning, but when I do, I find people are generally just going about their business. To a meeting, to school, back from the train station. You get the picture. Today was different when I was pinged by the app to go pickup at the hospital. A middle-aged gentleman was already waiting outside, which I always appreciate. The uncertainty of driving for an app is always put at ease when a friendly face is standing there waiting for you. The human connection is always nice to see and I much prefer it to a computer telling me when and where to show up.  We started to talk about the weather. The art of small talk is something I believe I have mastered, but my most interesting rides are always the ones that go far past these social norms. The conversation turned sharply as he said that he did not get to see much of the winter this year. My mind rushed to a long-term winter escape. Florida perhaps. So, silly me, I asked away.  “Did you get away for the winter? Lucky you!”.  “No, unfortunately not. I was in the hospital. You see, I had a stroke”.  Knowing very little about strokes or really what to even say, I wished him well in his recovery. We chatted about life, the recovery time, the agony of the doctor’s uncertainty. When could he return to work? Is this even in the cards any more? His entire being had changed in one moment. I suppose life is just a string of how we are doing today, this week, this month, this year. We forget how terrible it used to be when we struggled with a situation or event. With a medical issue, the loss of your first boyfriend or girlfriend, or even how shitty homework was to do in high school. Humans forget too easily and perhaps this is a helpful coping mechanism.

1,"Uber and Lyft getting on my last nervesFor the last 2 days I’ve had a driver cancel on me after waiting 20 minutes for the uber, which I have no doubt that he cancelled once he saw he had to go into UCF. They should be penalized or uber should cover my fee. Also what’s this bs about drivers starting the wait time? Had a driver start it before turning in to pick me up, and then miss the pickup and had to turn around. There are a lot of bad drivers out there, and people who don’t care.

0,"IMPORTANT:Attempted Lyft Scam while drivingToday while driving toward a passenger named Duc, I get a phone call from a 424 area code and I hit the button to decline the call with a text. I received a second call which I declined as well. On the third call, I pull over and accepted assuming the passenger has something important he wants to communicate with me. The caller says he is from ""Lyft passenger services department ""and that a recent passenger has reported that I have been using my cell phone while driving, which I very rarely have done. He says that he has to put a suspension on my account and that the company has already notified the passenger. He confirms the year, model, and color of my car along with my license plate number. I protest the use of my cellphone while driving and the caller states that if I have a dashcam, then I can send in the footage. He seems to backtrack and says that he can lift the suspension on my account. Then he says that he has sent a code to my phone and asks me to confirm it. Seconds later there is a text from Lyft with a code which I repeat to him. He then asks how many rides I have given this week and my balance. I estimated the rides, which were only a few as well and give him my balance. Which he seems upset about. The caller then tells me to cancel the upcoming ride on my phone which I do. Then the caller gets irritated and says that I need to log out of the system and ""Dont log in ever again! Ever!"" And then the phone went silent. I was confused and upset. A few moments later, I get a ride from another passenger and the ride is immediately cancelled. I am thinking Lyft cancelled the ride. I ended confused and looked again at the text from Lyft and it read ""please keep in private and do not give to anyone."" I drive down to the Lyft hub and spoke to the representative. She told me LYFT WILL NEVER CALL A DRIVER, THEY WILL ONLY EMAIL. She also said that another driver recently reported this today, but never heard of this before that. She also confirmed that the 424 area code is not an area code that Lyft uses. The representative was also not able to look up the customer, as it was a cancelled ride. The code I gave the caller was a login code, so she had a tech support log me out and re-enter all my banking info. Since it was not a Lyft phone call, I was wondering how they got my phone number. I figure the scammer booked a ride and was able to get my name and vehicle number. Somehow he had my phone number which he was using to log into the driver database. Then he got the login code from me. I am guessing he was looking for me to confirm I had more money in my account,and then he was going to change the bank deposit info and cash out my ride earnings for the week before they get automatically deposited into my account. PLEASE BEWARE OF THIS SCAM!! It was somewhat smooth as the caller was able to confirm several pieces of data including that I was currently on a pick up, which made him sound more legitamate, including having a text sent to my phone. As I look back, he changed his story about the suspension on my account and seemed upset at my account balance."

0,"Weird issue. Scam or something else?Im kind of new to Lyft, though I dont think that matters too much. I drive Lyft in a college town. I dont use the other service. Ive never been a rider.  I got a ping, good ways out of town. About 5 minutes. Okay, I thought, this should pay well. When I got there, my app glitched out and acted like I picked up the rider, and started directing me to their destination. So I tap the riders name and theres an option to call. It asks if Im sure I want to call the rider in my car, I say yes and it puts me through. She sounds confused. I say Im her Lyft driver and Im having a hard time spotting her. She says shes in her Lyft and she doesnt know what Im talking about. I wish her a good evening and apologize for the confusion. I assume Lyft double booked her ride and I dont worry about it too much.  So I drive back into town, and just as I get back into town she sends me another ride request. Well, she didnt send it to me specifically, but it came up on my screen. So, she told me she was in a Lyft and going to her destination... what would you do? Go back out there, run down the clock, and get $5 for a cancellation? I didnt get $5 for the first cancellation. So I declined it. And then couldnt get any riders for the next hour, though, it may have just been slow.  I had a good day compared to what Ive been having (but nothing like some of you folks!) so I really cant complain. But my acceptance rate went down from 100%, now its at 95%.  Should I bother Lyft with getting it fixed or just let it ride? Or does this sound like something where maybe I misread the situation and maybe I screwed up somehow? I cant help but feel like she was doing something improper. If she had just cancelled on me and then sent another request, I probably would have just gone back (again, it was slow), but what tripped me up was that she told me she got in another Lyft. So if thats true — and why would Lyft send two drivers way out of town, anyway? — why would she need another ride from her home? Same name, same address. No profile pic in either case."
0,"How to deal with MUSTY PASSENGERS? /RantToday I had 3 passengers who were pretty musty and it was quite unpleasant.   Pax #1:  polite man but extremely musty.

His scent was so offensive that I had to drive with the windows down. It was a shared ride too so I can only imagine how the other pax felt lol  Pax #2: nice woman but musty. Not as bad as the first guy but still bad enough to notice. I could tell she did not shower that day.  Pax #3: shy polite girl but smelled gross. I had to look back to see if she had any food in the car, but nope, it was just her musty ass! I had to air my car out for 5 minutes after she left.   Do yall just 1 star these MFs?

0,"Lyft drivers keep asking me to cancel the ride at LGA. Why?This has happened on 2 separate occasions and with a total of 7 drivers. I order a Lyft to pick me up at LGA and wait at the designated column. The app shows that the driver is there and waiting for me but I can’t find them at my column. After contacting them I get a myriad of excuses (my app isn’t working, my car won’t start, I can’t find the garage), and the driver asks me to cancel the ride. However, since it already says they are there to pick me up, I am not able to cancel. I live close to the airport... about a 10 minute drive. Are they seeing the drop off location and choosing to not pick me up? I prefer to use Lyft over Uber but this experience has been incredibly frustrating and support didn’t do anything but send me a $5 credit and a link to driver policies. Which does nothing to help me as a rider. "
1,"Signed up for Uber Gold and now my trips are far more costly. Can I undo this?I recently accepted the upgrade to Gold membership on my uber account. I use it several times each week and I thought it would only benefit me, however I immediately noticed that all my trips are costing about 50% more. I used to get anywhere from 30-50% off each trip, from what I assume to be for my frequent use of the service. However since I accepted the Gold rewards program Im noticing that the base price of each of my trips have increased I feel like, and Im not getting any discounts. This makes uber unaffordable for me now, can I undo these changes or did they discontinue these discounts that Ive been using?"

1,"Payment failure and spouse app issuesAbout a month ago I used Uber for the first time in a long time after a night out, using a relatively new debit card. After getting dropped off I got an email from Uber stating that my payment method failed, and then almost immediately I got a text from my bank asking if it was a fraudulent charge (which I denied). Thinking that Uber would simply try to charge me again, I went to bed not worried about it.   In the morning I checked my account and the payment still hadnt gone through. There wasnt even another email from Uber so I dont know if they even did try to charge me again.   Since then Ive had total radio silence from Uber, and this outstanding payment has been sat at the back of my mind. Ive deleted the card, re-entered the information, and added a second card onto my account. My trip receipt still says the payment is at £0 and I have no charge listed in my bank transactions. I tried ordering a ride a few days ago and, unsurprisingly, it wouldnt let me. Obviously I need to reach out to customer service but am unsure of the best way to do that.  Oddly, my husband has also been unable to order a ride on his account since this has happened, even though he wasnt with me or involved in the initial payment fiasco. Were thinking that possibly, because the second card I added is from a shared bank account, theyve blocked him too (which, if true, is insane).   What should my next steps be? Has anyone has a similar thing happen, particularly with multiple accounts being suspended?"

Ive made several orders at this location in the past three months and none of the drivers have ever had issues finding me.  I had no missed calls, and no voicemails or text messages, so I immediately texted the driver from within the Uber app which showed he had read it ([Screenshot](https://imgur.com/a/PLvE7rE) ). I waited another minute or two but got no response so I called the driver from the app which only got me to a disconnected number. Another few minutes passed and I got a notice that the time was up and my meal was gone with no chance for a refund. I was hungry and I was angry.  I contacted Uber support (an act which itself seemed intentionally difficult) was told that upon reviewing my case they had no intention to refund my order, even though I had made multiple efforts to contact the driver. ( [Uber Response](https://imgur.com/a/etSqf5V) )  My only recourse is to issue a chargeback with my credit card company, which I intend to do once this posts to my account. I was told by a few co-workers that theyve had similar experiences lately, so I figured I would warn this community about this since Uber seems to think this is an acceptable business practice. "

I was told via email by customer support their policy is they don’t issue any refunds or give promo codes because they “don’t want to monetize [my] safety.” I’m honestly shocked at this response and lack of concern for my safety as well as their pathetic excuse of “not wanting to monetize my safety.” They already monetized my safety and valued it at less than $5, hence the lack of a refund. Any similar experiences?"

1,"Is a passenger score of 4.7 considered bad?I recently checked my score on the uber app and my score is a whopping 4.7. I know its partially because I was in a foreign country and there was a language barrier between me and the drivers. Not sure if a 4.7 will detriment me getting rides in the future. I also think i got banned from Lyft, but I dont exactly know why.  "
1,"My fiancee has been repeatedly banned for ""being underage"" hes well over 18, looks his age and already provided proofThe driver somehow mistook him for under 18. He is 25, alright I guess some people arent good at telling ages. Fiancee sent a copy of id and got reactivated. Tried to order food and found out he was deactivated again.... For being under 18??? Weve resent the ID, a picture of his face with the ID next to it and a closeup picture of the birthdate on the ID. We thought this was successfully resolved what might be happening.   Also he did nothing to offend anyone. According to him he sat quietly and watched videos on his phone with headphones.  I havent used the service since he got banned the first Time even, I rarely ever ride alone, and either way Im 27.  Edit: got unbanned shortly after sending the email with extra extra proof. But I still want to know what anyone thinks is the reason for this."
0,"Referral codes switch from cash to Lyft credits?Ive been earning decent income each week for a couple of years with referral codes for new passengers.

It was just very sudden with no warning."
1,"Business owners, staff, friends, and family, do not dump drunks unaccompanied into an Uber ride. You just compound your own problems.Once upon a time, I was an ambulance chasing lawyer, an insurance claim adjuster who would hint for tips on the field and wrote the estimate accordingly. But my following advice is strictly limited to my job as a qualified Uber driver.    Whatever happens to the drunks, you are still responsible. So talk to your lawyer and insurance company before you choose to ignore me.   Now you are also responsible for the driver too if anything goes wrong. x2.0 surge.   Whatever you dont want to deal with, its much easier on solid ground, with plenty of witnesses. Things can turn out much worse on a fast moving car in the freeway when the driver cant even see whats coming at his/her back. x10.0 surge.   If you are not willing to call the cops when you should have, its much more likely for the driver to call the cops. If the drunk is hurt, the 1st thing the cops will do is to check whether he/she was hurt before the ride, that is, your place of business.   If the drunk can request the ride on his/her own and get into the car, you cant do anything otherwise. This is what drivers assume when they make their decisions. If you assist in any way, you are tangled. You are cheating the drivers.   USA maybe the only place on earth that if you walk into any place asking for a first-aid kit to treat your tiny bruise you got on the streets, trained staff will refuse. After phone calls up the chain of command, they may approve an unmedicated bandage to help you. Of course, they will sell you whatever you need if they have it in stock.   In the state parks, the staff wouldnt give me a jump start cable even though some strangers would like to help with their batteries. They are afraid that if my car is hurt, the park will be liable and they will lose their jobs.   Why would you risk dumping a drunk into a ride with a stranger?   Do you know anything about the drunk? What bad things he/she can be capable of? Do you know their medical history? Mental health history? Can they be carrying weapons or something that can be used as a weapon?   If you have to help, are you sure their addresses are correct? Are you sure they can operate their keys? Are you sure they can even walk to the door and get inside? Can you first call somebody on their contact list to find somebody to get them?   Will you leave your friends or family alone with a stranger? The background check is a joke. There is the first time for everything.  Case studies:   A bartender helps an older gentleman into the car to go home two blocks away. He is a regular and can still give me exact directions. But he just couldnt walk the two blocks under the influence. This is the only good case.  He even tipped me the next day, or the bartender did when his regular turned up sound again.   I think another bartender took a pax home in my car. The address is wrong. Either they dig up an old address or the drunk remembered the old one. The drunk was totally hostile and blamed me for everything, and for not driving to his home. He also threw up big time. Luckily, the staff controlled him so I can concentrate on driving. Luckily, the staff also manage to get the correct address.   A drunk college girl got into the front seat. The woman with her took one look at me and told the girl that I am OK and she wasnt coming with her. The girl protested but the woman just dumped her. I stopped at the driveway and asked her if it was the correct dorm. Luckily, she woke up without being shaken. She told me that she didnt know what I was talking about but that was the right place. She got out trying hard to walk normally. But then she came back to check if she left something, 4 times, checking both front and back seats. On the 2nd attempt, she did recover her big handbag. Leaving her alone or making sure that she get into something both have problems. Since its a campus, they should have decent CCTV coverage so I stayed in the car.   At closing, a sushi bar got rid of their last drunk customer by ordering an uber. He can walk into the car all by himself. He has a happy face always so I didnt even know he was drunk. I thought he was some kungfu master when he got out. He disappeared into the silent darkness as soon as the door was barely opened. When I got out to close the door, I found him who dropped vertically down, hugging the tire, unconscious. When I pulled him up he asked me to let him sleep on the sidewalk. I did and he slept with a happy face. Nobody was around in front of a big apartment complex. It was one of the safest counties in US but I thought if somebody took his wallet or he lost a kidney I would be accused anyway. So I pulled him up again when he begged me to leave him alone. It was a dead weight. Be he could walk with some help once he was upright. I took him into the apartment and asked him where to take him. He didnt seem to know the direction so I asked him the room number. He gave me the real number with a smile but then gave me a fake one in case I would clear his apartment. I tried to sit him down on the sidewalk but his head was like make of lead, falling on the blacktop. You can try sitting on the ground with your head touching the ground and even a few inches lower. Bizzare. I gave up walking around to find his home. I brought the car instead. But when I drove inside, he disappeared. I drove around and found him, instead of sleeping, walking fast like a zombie. He was like escaping from me who wanted to rob his apartment. I left when he seemed to find something to enter from afar.    The worst was a guy who screamed like an animal on the freeway. The staff must have helped him. When he walked the few steps to get into my car, he bumped into the car body hard. He told me to shut up repeatedly whenever I acknowledged his directions. He even hit me but I wasnt hurt. So I kept him instead of potential escalating of the situation. "
1,"rideshare delivery drivers blocking business driveway - what can we do?Hey all,     I work for a business thats directly next door to a restaurant thats just started offering both Uber Eats and Grubhub delivery. Our business has a narrow driveway that leads back to a parking lot which is used frequently by delivery trucks for our business and our customers. The driveway and parking lot are not shared with the restaurant and are reserved solely for our use. The street our businesses are on is busy and there is only extremely limited street parking.      We have had continual problems since the restaurant has started offering delivery with drivers for Uber Eats in particular (but also sometimes Grubhub) parking in our driveway entrance and blocking customers and our delivery trucks in/out. Our busiest business hours happen to coincide with dinner time so this has become a huge issue. We have signage on the walls of our buildings indicating that people should not block the driveway but it does not seem to be respected (and maybe isnt being seen). My fellow coworkers have resorted to harassing the delivery drivers in order to get them to not park there but given that few drivers are repeats and I assume given the time pressure drivers are under, they keep making the decision to risk parking in our driveway. (I dont support my coworkers harassing drivers and find it very immature.)     The manager of our business is considering now hiring a tow company to tow (!!!) any delivery drivers parked in the driveway. This seems just plain mean to me as well as stupid/inefficient (what would block the driveway more than a tow truck, after all). The manager and owner are older and dont seem to understand that towing individual drivers will not solve this systemic issue since I assume there is no one at Uber who would notice or care that the drivers are getting towed (which my manager insists is the case) and it will just hurt a lot of working people.     I was wondering a few things: is there a way for the restaurant owner to put a note on his end of either delivery app (Uber/Grubhub) for drivers so that they know/are warned not to block our driveway? (The owner of our business is fine with drivers pulling into our actual parking lot to park briefly during our business hours-- is there a way to get this across through the app?) Also, Im sure those here have dealt with similar issues from the driving end-- whats the best way to compassionately handle this and to let the drivers know that they can park in our lot but not block the damn driveway?"

0,"Damage Fee - haven’t paid; am I in legal/credit trouble?Hi!  I took a Lyft with my fiancé the other day - or tried to. My driver pulls up in the morning. I check the license plate so it’s the right car and we get in. As the driver starts to pull away he says that he isn’t taking us because we canceled. I say that’s not true, and we’d like to ride with him to our destination. He insists we canceled (we did not as we are still in the car expecting to start moving) and he starts being increasingly rude before finally just telling us to get out. On my way out I slam the door - but keep in mind, I am a 5’4” tiny tiny woman who hasn’t gone to a gym in years. My version of slamming a door is nothing with strength behind it. I know I didn’t close it on a seatbelt or anything that would cause damage. The driver starts screaming at us from half a block away that “(I’ll) pay for that” and he’ll sue. I was a bit shaken by his vitriol. Lyft charged me a cancellation fee for this driver which I successfully fought, and they promise to never match me with this guy again. Something for which I didn’t ask but appreciated. I didn’t even comment on his behavior; I purely mentioned that he insisted we canceled, likely having found a more expensive fare to pursue. Perhaps they promised this because he’s had past complaints.   Yesterday I received a Lyft customer support Email saying that I owe the driver 100 dollars because he can not open his door from the inside. Not the outside. Attached were two photos - both of the inner door handle, one where it’s being pulled and one where it’s at rest. There’s no indication of anything wrong with it. No scratches, nor video of the guy trying to use the door. Lyft attempted to charge my debit card on file, but my bank declined likely because no purchase was noted. I had several hundred in the account yesterday, so it’s not an issue of funds. Then they tried my PayPal, and I called PayPal and had the charge reverted.  Because I haven’t paid this fee, will I be sued or taken to collections? I on principle do not want to pay this fee - I think this driver operated unethically as did Lyft, attempting to charge before submitting formal notice and “banning” me from the app until I pay (not a problem, as I’m switching to Uber now). But since I haven’t paid will they pursue this further? I’m scared of that happening. Thank you! "

I understand traffic and other obstacles, but it seems unfair when they          say “ no later than 1:25” for example.” And you actually arrive at 1:40. The more annoying thing is I sensed this would happen based on the non-sensical route that was being taken. and they wouldn’t let me cancel unless I paid a fee. It wasn’t necessarily the drivers fault, they were just following the recommended route given by Uber. Anyways, any refund stories would be nice. "
0,"Lyft notifications cover ""Scheduled Rides"" calendar buttonI scheduled my first ride with Lyft, in the past I have only ever used them on-demand.    After doing so, I got no receipt and could not find my scheduled ride anywhere in the app.    After quite a lot of time and frustration, I discovered that a notification in the middle of my screen for 25% off my next 10 Lyft rides was covering up the scheduled rides button (calendar button) on the top right.    The only way I found able to access my scheduled rides at this point is by clicking on the calendar/scheduled rides button IMMEDIATELY after the app opens, before it is covered and moved off screen by the notifications.    I honestly couldnt find a single answer online, so I am hoping this can help someone else."

0,"Came back after a hiatus and had my first pukerThought Id return to driving this weekend to make some extra pocket money. The evening was going pretty well until I picked up this couple. It was obvious they had some drinks but they were pleasant and composed (so I thought). One minute away from the destination, one of the paxs pukes all over my backseat. I quickly pulled into a gas station to assess the damage. We agreed to end the ride right there and I left for the nearest supermarket to pick up some cleaning supplies. I cleaned up as much as I could in the parking lot but will deep clean everything in my garage tomorrow.   I immediately reported the incident to Lyft w/pics and they promptly replied back saying they charged the customer a $100 cleaning fee. One thing that kind of irked me, though, was Lyft saying I need to email them a receipt showing I actually purchased cleaning supplies. First, one of your gross ass customers expelled bodily fluids all over my car. Next, I lost out on wages that evening because I had to cut my shift short. I also sent you pics of the damage, which you charged the customer for. Its not like Lyft is digging into their pockets to pay me that cleaning fee. So them asking for a receipt looks cheap and shows how they distrust their own drivers.   Whatever, I just gotta get the smell of vomit out of my car."

And at least once a week I’ll get a driver that just sits there where they accepted the ride and not move towards me.... so then I have to cancel because I have to get to work, and sometimes even when I cancel and request a new ride I get the same driver. Most of the time the second time around they actually start driving but I just don’t understand the point? It makes things awkward and it wastes my time.. I’ve had to start ordering rides extra early just to be safe. Opinions?"
1,"Dodged a bullet this morningGot a ping this AM and at 1st glance it seemed to be good enough to accept. Headed to pickup. It was a commercial address. Innocent enough so I drove into the front facing parking lot only to see a series of hand stenciled signs with arrows guiding "" Uber drivers this way"". Turns out it is a private medical clinic. After I was guided to the rear lot by the series of 6 signs I see a final sign that reads "" Uber driver park here for pick up"" . While following these signs through the maze the countdown has begun as I am close enough to the pin. Snatch my Uber sign off the dashboard in case I am seen. The facilty is directly across the highway from  a mega complex for seniors. No doubt a $2.50 ride including loading a ""patient"" needing assistance. It is a corporate/company Uber account. Do a slow crawl out of waiting lot watching the countdown. No one ever came to the "" Uber designated waiting spot"" which most likely meant there would be a long wait. Boom..... cancel option became available and I called to CMA. Just a switchboard recording with options. Thanks Uber. Not your fault but these are shit rides that I cannot afford to accept. These type rides need better compensation. Gladly took my $3.90. I will remember that address. "

She didnt know her own strength, no drunk knows his/her own strength.  I couldnt talk or breath as she compressed my throat so I grabbed her arm and flinged it away from me.  These women are German or Scandinavian descent and their build is bigger than a lot of women in the world.  Never did I imagine a woman have that much strength.  There were 2 other incidents that had 2 guys with strong hard dense bone elbows hit me hard as a ""Get out of here"", joke kind of thing to them but why didnt realize their own strength and hit they did is actually assault.  As for the woman I didnt kick her out or call cops on her because I developed a connection with her and her friend and I told her boyfriend what she did to me the next time I picked him up, and he apologized and said he will talk with her.

1,New Rider needs help. App says it cant verify me. What the best way to contact their customer service?Heres my issue. Maybe someone here can help?  I downloaded the app today and I added an Uber gift card to the payment section. I have $40. Then I try to book a ride and Im told that new riders using the cash option have to verify themselves. I guess Uber gift cards are considered cash?  So I go to the verification screen and it says enter my Facebook. I dont have Facebook.  So it says instead I can do a digital verification. It then list options for me. Well the reason Im using a Uber gift card is because I dont have a credit card or PayPal account. So I cant verify myself with those. One of the options on the digital page is Uber gift card. Well I had already entered my gift card information and that apparently wasnt enough for verification.  This is frankly ridiculous. Lyft didnt give me these issues. I would just delete the Uber app and be done with them but they have my $40.  Does anyone know how Im supposed to verify my account?   Or  Can someone tell me the best method of contacting Uber customer support about this issue?  I have searched Google but couldnt find a sufficient answer.  Any help would be appreciated.

The driver was confused as well with this, and it was difficult for her to find me in the dark as there were no street lights there and the pick up location is not clear.

I could only think of one (at the moment) and he proceeded to tell me that his driver in New Orleans told him the worst passenger or experience they had was when someone started smoking crack in their car! I was like “WOW!”        My experience was when a female passenger was buying either crack or meth from a sketchy person at a gas station. She added the stop and said she needed to get something real quick and she’d be right back. She never got out of my car and called the guy over. That’s when I asked her what she was doing and she said she just needed to talk to him real quick. Then I started putting it all together as I overheard their conversation and I told her to get out!

0,"Tipping etiquetteTook a Lyft this morning and it smelled strongly of urine. Usually I always tip the drivers but I had a bad ride experience because it smelled so bad.

It takes her at least 2 mins to get out of my car as she is searching for something. Then she leaves her stuff in my car and goes in to fill a prescription according to her. I wait 10 mins and call her. She says she is checking out. Another 10 mins go by. I call her to tell her I am canceling. I cancel the ride, put her stuff on the space next to the car. It was not  in a parking space, but next to the handicap space where cars are not suppose to park to leave room for a handicap person to get out. Wasnt worried about someone running over her stuff as the CVS was pretty dead.   As I am pulling out she comes out. I honk at her to let her know where her stuff is. I start driving off and she goes to my car and opens the door while I am driving. I tell at her to stop and she turns around. She leaves my door open. I tell at her to close it and she says she was just checking to see if any of her things were still in the car. Who just opens the door while a car is moving?    I contact support and they give me $5. Great I should have made at least $10 for that trip.  Question, how long should a driver wait for passenger when there are two stops?  What do you guys do? "
1,"Uber drivers being approached by another company to answer questions in exchange for cash (UK).I have a friend who is an Uber driver and today he had a passenger who said they work for another company called Prive Chauffeur. After a quick search I found they are a company like Uber that operates in France and Portugal.   The passenger set the destination to a place where he said my friend could answer a few questions and get £50 and if he logged in to show them his earnings etc. they would pay him another £50. Apparently they had been doing this the whole day. He at the time was hesitant and was told by the passenger that he could come back to that place in the coming days if he changed his mind.  I searched around online and couldnt find anything about this.  I guess my question is, is this allowed? Are drivers allowed to answer questions about working as private hire drivers. Are they allowed to show another company their earnings and their hours through Uber?   A part of me is sceptical that this is not at all legit. £100 is a lot of money for a few minutes answering questions, but I dont want him doing anything that could risk his job.  Let me know what you all think. Thanks."

1,"Instant Pay IssuesSo I started Uber eats this past week and Ive taken about 2 deliveries (trying it out.) So naturally I wanted to instant pay, cash app unfortunately doesnt work with this.

I set up instant pay using the temporary card. I believe it was Friday when I tried to have my payment sent instantly. Literally the whole day it said pending and then at 10PM it said failed. The money is now nowhere in my account or GoBank. I decided to give it a couple days- afterall Im a new driver with a new account and a new card that isnt even a physical card.  Sunday comes. FINALLY. IT IS SENDING AGAIN AND NOT IN A STATE OF PERPETUAL FAILING. Anyway, I give it til the stroke of midnight (an hour ago for me.) and now it says payment was posted Mon. Mar 10th at 10:45PM.   Now the problem Im having is.  OKAY. YOU SENT THE MONEY. WHERE IN THE FUCK IS IT.  Is it because I have the temporary card? It says it sent to that card but then why do I not have the funds in my account? Will it show up during business hours? Is it because I am a new account on Uber/GoBank?

0,"Hi everyone, Im considering driving Lyft and just now learning a lot about ride share in general. I have a lot of questions, and was hoping you all might share some guidance.Hi Im new to the whole ridesharing system as both a driver, and a passenger. Ive actually never even used uber or lyft in the past. I started considering driving lyft because I left a job where the management, and structure of the company was just awful for employees. I guess I found a great deal of excitement in the idea of a job that is more closely tied to my own efforts, and less those of a superior.  Im hoping you all might be able to answer some questions. I know its alot. Thanks in advance.  1. Do you use the Express Drive Program?   2. If so, how much do you pay for a rental fee?   3. What are your average working hours weekly?   4. What is your average amount of customers weekly?  5. In the Express Drive rental program, it states that a down payment is required or a deposit on your rental. How much was your down payment?  6. It seems like the attitude I hear from most people is that ride share is terribly unsuccessful for most people, and that its not worth it. However, I then alternatively find people saying they do very well for themselves *if* they work 40-60 hours a week. Do you have any comments on this?   7. In regards to the Express Drive Rental Program, there is a down payment for the vehicle, and a (weekly?) rental charge. Are there any other hidden expenses you can tell me about?  8. On Lyfts website on the Express Drive program, they mention that they will pay the insurance, and maintenance costs for the vehicle you rent. However, Ive seen people on this sub mention the importance of having ride share insurance, is this something entirely different?  9. When you begin driving for Lyft, can you drive anywhere in the country? state? Do you pick a specific city first? I wanted to drive in NYC, but Im from the suburbs outside of it. Would I be able to do pick ups where ever I like? Im a bit confused on how this part works.  10. If you did the Express Drive program, did you have to wait for a rental vehicle to be come available? If so, how long did you wait?  BONUS: Im in NY and so I was thinking of driving in NYC. is there anyone here who might answer some questions I have regarding the market here?   Thanks again!"

1,Bad GPS navigation caused overchargeI recently took a trip with a quote of $5.50. The uber GPS screwed up which caused the driver to take a roundabout way to the destination and the final bill came out to about $26 not including the tip I left.   The driver was very apologetic and had the GPS in a place I could see it the whole time so I know he was actually following the route he was given. Is there somewhere I can go to inquire about the price that won’t screw over the driver since he didn’t do anything wrong?  Thank you!
1,"Has anyone had an experience that made you feel like you have to use Uber Critical Safety Response Line? If you have, what happened afterwards? (Want to have an idea of what to expect now that I just used it.)So just to preface what Im about to say, I spent almost two years of my life as a literal business-to-business solicitor, walking into around 100 peoples businesses each day. Ive seen all types of people  and have had more uncomfortable moments than I have time to tell, plus I actually drive for Uber myself, so its not like Im really sheltered and am overreacting.      Tonight I used Uber as a rider and I left the ride, (almost 20 minutes,) extremely disturbed by the experience I had with my driver.      I wont go into any details because theres an ongoing case that came from the call I made, but it was bad enough that I told him the app had the wrong address and had him drop me off over a quarter mile further into my neighborhood so he wouldnt know for sure where I actually live. Just to give him the fewest amount of reasons to think I was the one that reported him, I gave him 5 stars and a $10 tip. (I told her that I dont think its remotely unreasonable to get that money back, as I only did it as an act of self preservation.)   After I told the representative the complete story, they said their job was to transcribe my story and then hand the case off to the actual Critical Safety Response team and one of them would contact me within the next 48 hours.       .      So my question is has anyone ever been through the process of what comes next for me?   Are there things I should know going into this?   Did they inform you of the final resolution? If not, did they give you a reason why you couldnt know?   Im assuming they probably refunded you for the trip?      Thanks for whatever help any if you can give!  "

0,"Lyft wont let me get a ride from my roomie?Ive driven for lyft before and my roommate still does (through the rental program). I work pretty close by and, until recently, would order a lyft that would go to him. I would just tell him I had to leave and he would go online and, being right next to me, he would get the ride and take me to work.  Because the bonus program is rides based he found out he couldnt get more than two rides per day from me,  but i usually only need one per day, and even then only a few times a week.    For the past several weeks though weve found that his car doesnt appear in my app. ive tried probably 10 times over the past weeks to order a lyft from him and its never gone to him, and his car has never appeared on my map in the app. Annoyingly, lyft has assigned me to drivers who are up to 9 minutes away, or in the process of finishing a ride, but it wont give me the person standing right next to me. its almost seems like lyft wont let me request him because it gives him easy rides towards his bonus.

0,"First time driver - accepting shared ride on the app SUCKSLyfts driver app isnt user friendly AT ALL, at least not when you are doing shared rides! I just wish there was an easy way to click accept once youve accepted a passenger to prevent the following bs that just happened to me:  1) first customer  was a teenage male, English wasnt his first language so communication wasnt the best. He was a shared passenger, I picked him up, tried to accept him but couldnt find the button. I accidently cancelled the ride, thinking I was cancelling on a separate passenger who wanted to get in on the ride. So I essentially gave this boy a free ride in Atlanta traffic. Thanks  2) got a second guy. Lyfts navigation app took me to the wrong location. He called me, told me where he was, I put it in my separate Google maps and found him. He was a shared pax as well and it took me forever to find the button to indicate that I picked him up! Had to pull over into the gas station in order to do it. Luckily he was very nice about it   It shouldnt have taken all this. I just had a single pax that I was able to pick up and drop off with no problem, why should shared be any different?

1,"Surge Pricing: Uber paying driver flat rate, but charging customers percentage rate?I drove Uber for 4 months last year in between jobs. Thank God, I have a decent job now, but Im into economics and follow Uber pretty closely as I have experience using it as a source of income in the past.   As a driver, I relied on surge pricing to make my time profitable. Without surges, many hours throughout the day in my city were simply not worth the low pay.   Ive noticed that Uber has just recently switched to a flat surge rate. I have a few thoughts on this.   1) It wasnt changed to help drivers. Uber has consistently done whats best for their company to maximize profits and they do not take care of the drivers at all. From an economic standpoint, this makes sense. There are a sh*tload of drivers who continue to drive even when theyre earning less than minimum wage (when you calculate profit based on gas, time, maintenance, taxes, insurance, etc). Why should Uber pay drivers more if the supply of drivers is still sufficient?  2) Consistently bad changes like this are going to make more drivers switch to competitors such as Lyft (are there any others? Im not familiar). This is how capitalism works. Currently from my understanding, the ride sharing market is currently a duopoly (or at minimum an oligopoly if you count taxis as well) meaning the Uber is earning higher profits than they should be, while the drivers are receiving less than they should be, and the riders are paying more than they should be.  Now Ive heard on this subreddit that Uber is paying drivers a flat surge price, but are still charging customers based on the old multiplier model and then pocketing the extra profits (as the multiplier undoubtedly results in higher fares and increased revenue than the flat rate method). Im not sure on the legality of this, but at the minimum its incredibly poor business practice and imo unethical.   As a closing note, for those familiar, some economists have done research using Uber proprietary data and it has been discussed on the freakonomics podcast. Uber was also mentioned in the book Misbehaving by Nobel prize winning economist Richard Thaler. Thaler (wrongly) assumed that surge pricing (which is a dynamic pricing model which fluctuates to match supply with demand) that surge pricing wouldnt have a significant impact on supply (the # of drivers). I can say, as Im sure most of you can, that youre definitely more likely to be out on the streets driving if there is a high surge occurring. I just thought it was interesting that a nobel prize winning economist would be so wrong in that aspect. ""Individuals respond to prices"" is Econ 101.   Ill close with saying that even though I often was very frustrated with Uber as a company and that I would often be livid with the app, their business practices, etc., I still enjoyed and appreciated that it allowed me an opportunity to earn income without having to work at a company. And the work was quite enjoyable (driving around my town, conversing with passengers, and listening to music/podcasts)  Anyways, long post, but Im fascinated with the economics of Uber and just curious what you guys think regarding the above. Appreciate any comments."

He was honked at a couple times. He also would slow down dramatically when merging, which is doubly dangerous. It was not a good ride and at the time, it felt like giving the low rating was the right thing to do. In the 100+ rides Ive taken, Ive only ever given three sub-5 ratings and this was my first 3 star.   However, I got a scary email from Lyft support afterwards saying they would ""take appropriate action"" against the driver, and now I feel terrible.

He wasnt driving in an unsafe manner otherwise, and he was looking carefully; just not signaling.  I immediately sent a follow up report to Lyft support asking to raise the rating to 4 stars and to not penalize the driver, just make sure he sees my comment (which I understand he would, in a summary at the end of the week). I fear though that this is too little too late.  To the drivers here--is this guy doomed? What should I do in the future when I encounter behavior that should be fixed, but I dont want to ruin someones livelihood? The star system is so flawed. "
1,Taxes CanadáHello  Uber driver in Canada here  Wondering if anyone have a guide to pay taxes or is using quickbooks. Thanks guys 
1,"Never ending uber support saga - month 5Im posting this with hopes that someone with a brain at Uber may see it and help me.  Or maybe someone else with a similar problem has found the magical path to fix it, because I have failed, over and over, for months.  I am a happy uber user, have been for years.  Randomly last September, I started getting ride receipt emails to a second gmail address that I own.  This gmail address is NOT linked to my uber account, and my uber account was not compromised.  What happened was that some idiot signed up for an uber business account and typod their gmail address so its now linked to my gmail address.  Thanks for riding, Jake!  My name is not Jake.  I have emailed Uber support literally dozens of times to ask them to unlink that account from my email address, but they fail every single time.  Most just ignore me and never respond.  Some try something, but it doesnt work, and then they never respond again.  Some say they will escalate the issue, and nobody ever responds.  Some say to wait for a response, dont respond, and then close the ticket so that my follow up email says it will not be received.  Its infuriating.  From what I gather from all of the responses Ive cobbled together, this is an issue with some business setup.  All of the emails have a cc named [""receipts@concur.com](mailto:""receipts@concur.com)"".  They claim that this is a problem with gmail not uber (lol).  As most people know, all gmail addresses include the same address with a period or hyphen, so for example JSmith@gmail is the same as J.Smith@gmail or JSmith-work@gmail.  Uber doesnt recognize that, so I assume this person signed up with some variation of my email address.  My biggset complaint is that Uber doesnt make the person verify their email address!  They only care about the mobile phone number.  And there is no unsubscribe button in the email so I cant say its incorrect.  And I cant log into the account or reset the password because you need that persons phone number/code.  Its an endless circle of getting nowhere.  Ive provided months of trip logs from the emails for them to identify and fix this.  Nobody has succeeded.  Is there any solution to this?  The guy is clearly a business man travelling all over the place.  Im at the point where Id love to just contact this impostor personally and tell them to fix their damn account.    HELP!"

Showing that the trip was paid at whatever per mile and time. They literally don’t read these. "

He recently tried to get a ride and  the driver reported him to UBER somehow.  They have disabled his account.  They have taken the money he had in the account (about $130) They are not replying to my email inquiries.  What next... small claims court?

0,"What happens when theres a mechanical failure? AITA or is Lyft support being useless?TLDR: car breaks down. Lyft support completely ignores my complaint...  My original complaint details the fact that the car hit a pothole and got a flat. Driver gets out and just tries to change the tire without avail and does not cancel my trip. I send a complaint to Lyft and I get this VERY useful response (see below - obviously cant find the original complaint in their system...)  Really? Im supposed to waste 30 minutes on a ride that doesnt get to my destination, NOT get to my destination, and then have to spend time with a rep who doesnt even review my request?  Support (responding to my original ticket and ignoring my complaint):  Hi Slayers, Thank you for reaching out to us about your recent ride. I understand that being dropped off at your exact destination can make a big difference. I recalculated your ride with &lt;driver and your trip cost shouldve been &lt;amended amount. Ive issued a refund of &lt;(about 10% of the trip). Depending on your bank, it may take 5-7 business days for the amount to post back to your account. If you have any other questions or concerns, feel free to reach out to us, and well be happy to help.  Me:  Hi, What about the fact that the driver did NOT end my trip and tried to repair the car? The trip, which should have been a 10 minute ride ended up taking about 30 minutes, and I didnt even get to my destination. What happened in the case of mechanical failure is horrible procedure and not acceptable. I would have expected the driver to end the trip, allowing me to request a new trip immediately and be compensated for that trip from insurance since this is not a fault of my own - largely due to the fact that there was a huge amount of time wasted on my part. Not only did this not happen, Ive been given only a $1.68 refund and zero explanation on what should have happened in my trip and what to expect in the future. I know that accidents happen and the driver was not completely rude but there should be training and proper protocols for drivers to follow for when mechanical failures do happen. Please review the entire trip in detail. You can agree from the trip information that I am not lying about the situation and that the car was stopped for close to 30 minutes without moving.  Support:  Hi Slayers, Thank you for getting back to us. Rest assured that we are always working with our drivers to continually improve the service that Lyft provides, so hearing your feedback is extremely helpful. We will do our best to give you the best Lyft experience in the future. If you have any other questions or concerns, feel free to reach out to us, and well be happy to help."

I probably had to make four orders before I got a car to take me home. First guy cancelled on me because he was stuck in traffic. The next two though didnt come or maybe did come but didnt call or signal to let me know that they were there. They marked me as if I had gotten in the car and went to go pick up the next guy. I cancelled both of them and got credit for it.  The guy that actually picked me up got out of the car and pointed at me to ask me if I had requested his uber. Im not sure if this is whats supposed to happen or if that was just him being nice. I dont usually use uber, definitely wont again but was I the one at fault here or were the drivers just assjoles?"

1,"Should we pay fine?Hi, I live in South Africa and my flatmate got a call tonight from our other drunk flatmate and he was asking us to come pick him up.   So we called an uber and we drove to the club where we see him standing outside. The road was filled with cars so we asked our Uber driver if we could get out and fetch our friend and we asked if the driver could come back and pick us up from the other side of the road.  The Uber driver now pulls up, we have our friend and we need to get into the car. The problem is that there is no parking so the Uber stops in the middle of the road while we jump in.. As soon as we get in, a traffic cop standing a few meters in front of us, pulls the car over.   The traffic cop then says he will fine the driver for disrupting traffic (we only blocked a car for about 5 seconds) the Uber driver gets the fine(R1000 fine which is roughly 100 $) and he drives us back home.  Now at arrival the Uber driver (nice guy) asks whos going to pay, we ask for his contact details and say we will sort it out tomorrow.  Now I am in this position.   We are students and dont have lots of money so, should we pay the fine, is there a Uber law that protects us?  What can I do?   "

A whole freaking lot. Despite that though at the end of the week, every week im still at the $15-$25 per hour gross range I like to be in. So I dont need to do to be driving from opposite corners of my market to make money or long trips. What matters most is efficiency."

0,"Banned from Lyft for multiple accounts😠I was recently banned from Lyft for having multiple accounts, due to the app CONSTANTLY requesting that I add a second card with the same address as the first😠. How much sense does it make to break your own app, rendering it useless and then placing the blame on a customer that frequently utilizes your services?   On top of that, the level of customer service while interacting with your support team was severely lacking. They offered no solution, replied with three word sentences and obviously failed to look at my ride history or social media presence.

0,"Any tips on getting a full refund from the service?On February 9th we (myself and 3 teenage boys) caught a Lyft from our AirBnB trying to get to an event in Seattle. This was during “snowpocalypse” but it wasn’t snowing heavy at the time although it had the night before.  Our destination was 8 miles away, and we had given ourselves plenty of time, leaving 2 hours before our event started.  When the driver picked us up, it should have been the first sign this was a bad idea. Even though we had requested the ride in the app at the 7-11 on one side of the road... he was at the casino across a 4 lane road and said we had to walk across to him...  Either way, we started the ride, and he ignored the GPS a couple times because he didn’t like the route it was taking or because he couldn’t change lanes before the turn.  We got about 4.5 miles into the trip with him taking another incorrect turn... and taking us in the wrong direction from our goal... when he freaked out and said he couldn’t make it and made us get out of the car.   I understand he might be worried about safety... but he didn’t even try an alternate route. He didn’t offer to stay til we could find another driver with an equipped car. He didn’t offer to take us back somewhere safe. He just abandoned myself and the 3 kids in the middle of nowhere in below freezing temperatures.  His car wasn’t equipped for snow... he shouldn’t have even been operating. But for him to freak out like that and abandon us is what pisses me off.  (He was also a dual Uber/Lyft driver and had gotten a ping on Uber which he didn’t cancel so I kind of think he just wanted to get to that ride)  We ended up walking up a hill for 30 minutes before we found a gas station and waited for another driver to finish our ride.  We BARELY made the event and we’re a few minutes late. I attempted to contact support a few times... but get nothing but automated copy/pasted responses, and a partial refund of $3...   Any advice?"

She picks me up and has her kid in the front seat? i I didnt make a big deal out of it, but I got my driver a drink from work since it was late. Then I went back in to get her daughter one so she wouldnt feel left out because she did look upset. We head over to krispy kreme and I said Ill make it quick. I go inside then all of a sudden I see shes behind me? I say oh you wanted donuts too? She said yeah. I was a little shocked because I just paid for mine. I said I was going back to the car because I got the hot ones and wanted them to stay hot.   She literally had me waiting for her to get donuts with her daughter in the car. I dont know if she still had the time thing going but that was NOT cool. I shouldnt have to wait for the driver. She ordered more than me. Thats when I was actually upset. It was only for a few minutes, but I was tired and wanted to get home. When I saw the total it was $14 rather than $13.   I contacted lyft about what happened and they said they couldnt refund me because thats not in their policy. This really sucks because i went from uber to lyft. Uber is still way worse but this really sucked. I did not tip her either and gave her 1 star. I have never done that before either"

It was clearly too big, and probably would have scratched a lot of stuff back there.  The third XL ride was an older lady going to the airport....tomorrow morning. She said she scheduled it on the app and had no idea why I showed up today. Then she refused to cancel, so I didnt get a cancellation fee because after running out the timer, the Lyft app kept telling me to driver closer to the rider, when I couldnt drive any closer because of the gate.  Im considering not taking any XL rides unless they are 45+ long rides. Most other XL rides I get are minimum fare ($4.80) and theres always some kind of drama attached to them."

1,"How to always get the full payment from ""premium pickup possible""   I used to never get any pickup fee on the vast majority of these rides and when I did it was around a Dollar. Whenever I accept a premium pickup possible ride now Ill stop at the nearest speedway and get coffee which takes like 7-9 mins (about how long it says itll take me to reach my destination). Then after the amount of time Uber thought it would take me to reach the destination I start driving to the customer and pick then up. When I look at the fees for these rides Uber gets like 20 cents because Uber assumed it wouldnt pay me a long pickup fee and charged the customer a rate based on that.

While playing around in the app last night entered a location in NYC to see if the app would let me (I live in Montgomery Co., Maryland, so that’s some distance away- Google Maps estimates it as over 4 hours from my place to the location I selected in NYC).   So I wanted to ask here: if you saw somebody’s ride request pop up and it said they wanted to go somewhere hours away, how would you feel about it?   (**Note:** I was very careful *not* to request an actual ride when I was playing around last night. I feel like I need to make that especially clear so I don’t give anybody the wrong idea.)  Edit: I think I failed to make this clear in the initial post, but this is all hypothetical. I wanted to see what drivers would say to such a request- and everyone who’s replied seems to have done so, thank you!- but I’d like to clarify further that I’m not planning on making such a request any time soon. If anything, this would be filed away for future reference, lol."

1,"Scheduled ride a day in advance. Driver arrived ten minutes before the scheduled window of timeI’m not blaming the driver for this, but it seems like there’s a glitch in Uber’s scheduled ride system, and I feel like griping about it this morning. I take Uber almost every day, and this has happened to me multiple times.  For clarity, when a person schedules a ride far enough in advance, Uber guarantees that the driver will arrive within a fifteen minute window of time starting with the time you selected and if they don’t arrive in that window of time, you will get $10 off your next ride.   I scheduled an Uber last night for 6:30am today.  The pickup window was 6:30-6:45. I always do this, and most drivers get to me by close to 6:30, give or take a couple of minutes on either side.   This morning, my driver arrived at 6:17am. That’s nearly fifteen minutes early, and if I’d have told him I wasn’t ready yet, he would have charged me a late fee even though according to the time I scheduled, I wasn’t late.  This has happened multiple times. I’ve taken to getting ready 30 minutes early to avoid having to scramble to get out the door. On top of that, I can’t always get inside at my work until 6:45, so when the driver is that early, I often have to wait in the cold for a substantial amount of time. It sucks, but it doesn’t seem like very many people are having this problem, so Uber isn’t likely to do anything about it.  "

I had a pax report me on Uber due to “Comfort” because they had chose a “Pool” ride during the busiest hours of the day (my car was naturally full) and actually had that report strike against my account.   I had driven for Uber for a grand total of a month and a half before getting perm deactivated due to mass reporting. I had multiple reports of “unsafe driving”, which is total BS considering: 1) I have never gotten a speeding ticket ever 2)Never been in an accident ever 3)Always practice safe driving skills and use turn signals 4)Try as often as possible to stay within the speed limit 5)Be a courteous driver both to other drivers and my Pax  I’ve never been reported once on Lyft.

What I’m concerned about is the tech portion... using the app. My dad is not tech-savvy at all. He has a smartphone and can text, call, and surf the web to an extent... but whenever he needs help with something, he asks me and my other siblings. I’m afraid his lack of tech knowledge &amp; experience will prevent him from being a successful driver.    From my experience, passengers can be added to queues and when it’s a shared ride. They can also change the destination. I don’t know what else is done through the app.   I’m afraid my dad shouldn’t pursue driving Lyft or doing any ride share app, and I’m wondering if my fears are valid so he should consider other options. Any experiences are appreciated."
0,airport q. lyft. pings from outside the qlast night i got upset.   lyft kept pinging me  to pick up pax outside of the q.  i lost my spot 3 times !  i declined the rides .  i turned off lyft and took a uber.  it was 12 am not in the mood to pick up drunks and make bs money.  i called lyft on the return trip and its  very hard to find a way to call lyft even worse then before.  lyft said update the app. im already up to date.                  anybody else have this issue with lyft ?  the pings were about 3 and 5 minutes away . i turned down about 10 rides from inside the q last night  many requests were from the same pax over and over.
1,jump bike - How do you know if you’re in a no parking zone before you get there?I’m interested in taking a jump bike to work but don’t want to park far away.

1,Im looking into a claim for uber compensation?I did some uber driving for a few months. Now Im getting a facebook post talking about uber compensation in my state.

1,"Bad driving: To report or not to report?I dont use uber very often but have always given drivers five stars over the past three years of using the app. Drivers have given me five star ratings in return and I appreciate how difficult it must be to make money using the service. I usually tip for good service too because of the hustle.  However, I recently took a short trip with a highly rated driver which had one thing after another. The driver had trouble finding me, even after he called and I told him the exact location, but thats forgivable because the pin was slightly incorrect. Then during the ride, he asked me what I do for a living and when I told him, he said ""that makes you hot"". So I didnt talk much after that.  These are uncomfortable, but not reasons to dock  the driver too badly imo. But then he missed a turn and didnt notice, drove like less than 10 km/hr on a residential road, and made a left turn from a right turn lane even after I said he had to turn left. He didnt seem to be paying enough attention to the road, and Im concerned about bad driving.  So I got to my destination and just had regret about not taking a taxi, but a friend suggested complaining. I did that, and got a refund, but still am unsure about how uber does quality control for these things and feel guilty for reporting something that didnt result in a major accident, if other riders seemed to be happy with the driver. Im not sure what standard of quality to expect from uber and tbh taking a taxi just seems like less pressure so I dont have to rate someones driving from now on.  Looking up how people choose to rate uber drivers, there seems to be some debate and vitriol over passengers who give bad ratings. Especially if the driver doesnt feel like they did anything wrong, which I can see happening with unaware bad drivers. How do you know that something is worth notifying uber or giving a reduced rating, when these things can make or break a driving career?  Tldr: I had a bad uber driver and complained, but an unsure if I did the right thing because other people gave high ratings. Where do people draw the line with reporting bad driving that doesnt result in an accident? Considering taking taxis instead from now on to save the headache."

He also made sure to display all his cash tips which I thought you werent supposed to do. Right in the passenger seat and constantly talking about how he shouldnt have accepted the ride. My wife being the kind hearted person she is wanted to tip him when we got in the store I said no because he tried to bully us into doing it and gave him one star for being a dick, I kid you not this dude picks us up again when we were leaving Rochester and making a quick stop at the gas station. And the whole ride bitches that we were going only a couple miles when we got out he tried to bully us saying a few days ago some people gave him one star on a Walmart trip and said you better give me 5 stars because some people gave me one and messed me up.  Seriously fuck that guy.  Anyway thought Id share my horrible experience   Edit:  TLDR: Driver was an asshole that made my wife and I feel bad for being picked up, constantly reminded us the entire 10 minute ride that we inconvenienced him, and showed his tips off like a 2$ whore I rated one star for bullying us."

Just because I dont want to be paired with you in the future (sorry). - Asking me to carry your groceries when youre abled bodied to do so. - Changing your drop off location constantly ( Specially bar hoppers on weekends).   4 Stars:  - Have an unpleasant smell.  - Sitting right behind me when youre alone. - Asking personal questions.  - Asking to speed or make illegal turns.  5 Stars:   Everyone else.     Canceling rides:   - Having a pet thats not a service dog. (Emotional support pets arent services dogs). - Minors  - Having a baby thats under 1 without a car seat. - Extremely drunk people.   "

0,"Lyft Express Drive program A ScamLyft is making it their new business to scam drivers out of deposit. Lyft is securing these deposits without specifying all the many different requirements that neccessary. On the application it say it only requires a drivers license, credit card and phone with Lyft App. Hertz does not honor these requirements at all. Hertz will only honor in state DLs , which is completely ridiculous because if it wasnt through Lyft they (Hertz) would only require a credit card. Lyft will remove these funds from your account without out specifying this detail. After the driver is denied by Hertz Lyft will then take up to 5 business days to return these funds ($250.00).  I dont know about any other drivers but if i had $250 just to put out for no reason i would not be driving for Lyft. So far UBER has shown much more driver support. This is a outrageous. The benefits of a low rate rental is great, just dont even think about trying it until you have every single detail.  "

To summarize, I take ubers a lot and every single time I do NOT select the ""short walk to and from destination"" option on a pool that saves you money. Yet every single time I am only picked up from my location- yet still forced to walk once Im somewhere around my destination. Every time. I explained this.    The first person that responded tried to tell me this is an ""optional feature"" and that I can choose to accept it or say no thanks on the app. This is **patently false**. It simply says a notification that ""to save your driver time we will drop you off somewhere else.""   I explained this further. They said that ""they know I wanted to be compensated but cant at this time.""   Never said I wanted compensation. This was an absolutely pathetic response to a serious issue of false advertising and PURPOSELY misleading the consumer so they are forced to get an Uber X.

0,"Should I report this driver/experience to Lift, and if so, how?Thanks in advance for any advice on the best way to handle this super uncomfortable experience! Ill be as brief as possible.  Recent trip with my wife, we needed to get from downtown to the airport in two hours. Chose Shared as Google/Apple Maps concur its about a 40 minute drive at that time. So I call a Lyft, and text the driver what side of the (4 lane) one-way street were on....  Driver goes to wrong location, calls, asks where were going, blames me for not telling him where we were, asks me to come to him, then changes his mind and goes around the block to get us. Car wreaks of cigarette smoke, the box of which is in the cupholder. Driver again asks where were going, then informs us that because its so far he has to stop for gas, and proceeds to do so with us in the car.  After were on the way, he tells us that well never make our flight in time using Shared, so he should just cancel any rides that come in and we should tip him the difference. My wife asks how much that is and when well know the approximate total, he responds ""usually a few dollars, but whats the convenience worth to you? $10? $20? You tell me."" I tell him were not comfortable with that and that were very sorry to waste his time and will get out and call another (non-Shared) Lyft. He refuses this offer, cancels a ride that was coming in, explains to us that hes just lost money and that hes going to take us the whole way (so not stopping to let us out) but reiterates that we should tip him additional for it.  He then tells us that we need to use the express lane and that we should tip him the $3 that will cost him. I tell him that we have plenty of time and that its not necessary, but he insists and uses the express lane anyway.  All the while hes making phone calls to friends, leaving voicemails, checking his bank account on his phone, and driving with headphones in the entire way (as such, he had to swerve and hard-brake a few times).  I tried to be very nice and apologetic so as to protect my rider rating since he seemed peeved we werent up for tipping him largely for his inconvenience, and did leave him $4 and 3 stars since he got us there insanely fast (and the non-Shared price was ~$4 difference).  Am I crazy, or is this totally unacceptable? Should I tell Lyft about this? How, just with the ""get help with this ride"" option in the app?"

Lyft is telling me that my code was never applied even though it was in the referral url I sent to him and was during the entire process.   Lyft says now that hes active, they cant change it at all. They said it looks at the system and decides which is the better bonus for the new sign up and applies that. So basically, the person who called me is saying ""referrals dont matter, sorry, refer someone else, maybe it will work next time.""  This is absolute bullshit and because of it, Im now out the 300 dollar referral bonus. On top of it she told me to try referring someone else. Why would I even do that if it didnt work the first time and when she admitted to me theres an algorithm that just decides whether or not is should ignore that I even referred a person.

My response to Lyft was asking them if they really wanted me to kick all the passengers out of the car and tell them to find another ride home just because support is too lazy to fix ride types, and of course Lyft is going to never respond to that email.  The passengers were bragging about stealing a pitcher (it had ice and lemons in it and didnt smell like alcohol), and then raised nine kinds of hell when I refused to make an illegal left turn, which continued for the whole ride.  They even agreed the turn was illegal, but ""everyone else does it.""  I really thought about just stopping and letting them walk a few times, and when they got out and slammed the doors hard enough to actually rock my suburban I wish I had left them a mile away from their house.

0,Connecting to Lyft system errorI worked for about 2 hours tonight and I only got 1 ride request.  I keep getting this error message despite having perfect mobile data coverage **lost connection with Lyft system**    I noticed its happening a lot lately. Ill be in a high demand area and everyone around me is getting tons of ride requests and Im getting none or very little. Not sure how to fix this. I tried everything Lyft told me to do but nothing seems to work for me. Any suggestions? 
0,Well finally got my ride dropped off!So I wonder how long to get all these riders fares correct. Even though the system was down it tracked me I went back home and a $12-15 ride costed the person $35. I didn’t accept any Uber or Lyft request during this time just to limit my movement. This girl works at sonic and I hope she haves enough money to get home. Other drivers check your rides and be honest and submit help requests to Lyft to refund your passengers.

1,Cancel a scheduled tripSo what’s the damage when I schedule a trip for example in SF and I needed to get to the airport and leave at 5am.  So I schedule it and get one driver to accept then he cancelled so then I try another and they cancel at this point i am concerned about making the flight.... so a taxi comes by and I get my ride that way....   Do they know I need to get to the airport?  It’s got to be like a 40-50 dollar ride and I have 5 star rating and always tip.  
1,"Who has gotten invited to Uber Rewards?I am in New York City, which had Uber Rewards launch here in December, but I still dont see an option to sign up for it in the app.    Just curious, out of people who are in Uber Rewards launch cities (Miami, Denver, Tampa, New York, Washington, DC, Philadelphia, Atlanta, San Diego), who has had the option to sign up in the app? Just would like to get a sense of what percentage have had this feature rolled out to them or if Im just extremely unlucky.    Ive tried asking support why I dont see the option and I just get copy/pasted stock responses, but it really bothers me that Im not eligible. The only perk I actually value is in the ""Blue"" (lowest) tier which is $5 for every 500 points earned and seems like a pretty decent perk."
0,"Does Lyft properly train its drivers?A friends experience, yesterday, trying to get home from work (Philadelphia) to her two kids.  Warning: Long, True, and hilarious (not at the time) post ahead.  So I finished work a little late today, and knew the next train I would be able to make would get me home after 630. In an effort to get home faster, and spend time with the kids, I checked out Uber and Lyft. Lyft could take me home for $42. Yes, I know that’s insane, but I work in X, and live in Y. It’s a long ride either way. But I wanted to get home. So this nice older gentleman picks me up.    We’re chatting, he has his phone in his hand, with the gps going, talking to him. No big deal. He’s asked me where I’m going, and where is Hatboro. No big deal. I open my phone and my laptop and start working. Since I know I’ll be in the car for a minimum of 40 minutes to an hr, I got some time. He asks me which way he should take to my house.... ok. I tell him whatever way the gps is saying- it’s telling him to go on 76, so he does that. He continues to ask me which way to go, even as the gps in his hand is telling him “make a right” etc. We’re close to the exit to get on 476. He asks me which way to go again. No biggie- I look up, and say to take exit GOBBLEDYGOOK. I’ve done this route before, I’m like 20 min from home. I go back to my work.   I look st the time. It’s now 630. When I should be pulling up to my house. At this exact moment, my driver says- oh N, what I weird name. Guys. I live in Z. We’re at N. N! We’re 30 minutes away from my house now. Now he’s asking me where to go again. I tell Him to listen to the gps it’s telling him to get off and get back on. He gets off the turnpike. Dead stops 200 feet before the toll booth and says- wait, I need a ticket? WHAT? he gets up the the booth and proceeds to ask the person why he now has to pay the full 40$ fee. Which is explained to him 3 times. He said there was no place to get a ticket. He says he has no money. He asked me for money. He then pays with a credit card. We get off the turnpike. Ans now it’s telling him to loop and get back on and go the opposite way. He finally figures this out, and TURNS RIGHT FROM THE LEFT TURNING LANE. Into... wait for it. A FUCKING ROYAL FARMS.   He goes to get out- and I start freaking. I said- where the hell are you going??? I have to get home? His answer? Well, I need money since I have to take the turnpike. This is real like folks. We get back on the turnpike. He pulls over onto the shoulder because he can’t figure out if he should be on here.  This is after the stopping and backing up into a different lane to get the ticket he didn’t get the first go around. He is now asking me every 5 minutes why he hasn’t seen a sign for Z, while he’s doing 90mph. We FINALLY get off at the correct exit. He ASKS THE TOLL BOOTH DRIVER WHERE Y IS ANS HOW TO GET THERE. I am now hollering from the back “Take the only road you’re on and then turn right!!!!” The toll booth guy is just freaked and says “well it’s more or less up and to the right” We get off the ramp, HE GETS IN THR LEFT HAND LANE. I am now full hollering in the back about getting in the right (I’m hollering over the god which is still telling him the way to go, this whole time, with a map, in case you forgot).   We are finally 2 blocks from my house which I have given him explicit directions to. I just want to get out of this god damned car. I ask him to pull over at the second stop sign. He pulls over at the first and says, aren’t you getting out? Can you please pull over at the second one, like I said? His parting words as I got out of the car- All I can say about the missed stop sign is I’m sorry. How is this my life??? Pictures are the proof of how long and where we went.  UPDATE: Lyft has given me a $5.00 coupon, valid for 30 days. This is ridiculous!!! I am not paying $88 for this insane ride!"
1,"Getting old trip reports?I have a business profile with uber with the monthly trip reporting turned on. I recently lost access to the email it sent the reports to (left my job, the reports were sent to a company domain email) and have been trying to figure out how to view the reports online. I was able to download all my data in a giant packet from Ubers help site, but it doesnt differentiate between regular and business profile rides. As far as I am aware, connecting it to an expense software will only track rides from that point forward.    Am I screwed or is there a way to get my old business profile reports?"

If that is true it really screws with my head and my excel spreadsheets makes driving not as enjoyable as it should be.

1,"Passenger left Car keys in my car, best way to return?So I was driving both uber and lyft that night,  so that even further complicates things,  but one of my passengers left their car key s (keys to a Hyundai) in my car. didn;t find it until the next day after I finished driving that night, so I have n o idea which trip on which platform left it.    Wondered if anyone else had something similar and had success returning them.  I could only imagine if that pax only has 1 set of keys and now cant drive anywhere.   I reported it to both Uber and Lyft,  so I suppose ill just hang tight and see if anyone contacts about it.   Prior to this, someone left their phone in the car,  but fortunately their mom called so I was able to contact that person through his mom and get his phone back to him.  left me a nice tip too in addition to the finders fee Uber gives.

1,Cant tip the driverSo I ordered a ride for my fiance yesterday and went to tip today (on PC)and when I click to tip him it says there was a problem with my payment even though it went through fine and shows up in the recent transactions on our bank mobile app. Any ideas? The guy was great and helped her out with her elderly Vietnam vet father so I dont want to stiff him on his tip. Any help would be appreciated!

0,"Thanks, I hate it!Passenger pinged me for a ride twice and canceled. Once was when I arrived and another was when I made the u-turn to leave her cul-de-sac. I contact lyft for cancellation fee and they rejected on the basis that I was there for a minute and 56 seconds and 10 seconds for the second ride. They also tell me that she tried a third time but it didn’t go through. I feel like a passenger who gets the same driver three times in total and cancels should be charged "
